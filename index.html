As a young child she talked to animals and always had a deep, instinctual love of nature that would remain until the end of her life.While her father, John Scully, a north Philadelphia beat cop, worked nights, her mother, Julia, would tell her children stories about their tribal roots and heritage. Each night Julia would recite the same Navajo folklore she had learned from her mother growing up on the Four Corners Reservation in New Mexico; magical stories that had been passed down through the generations.One special favorite of Julie and her little brother was the legend of the good witch Spider Woman. When the ancient Navajo stepped out of the third World into our present fourth one, Spider Woman, who possessed strange, supernatural powers, used her magic to help them fight evil monsters.Julie and John loved to hear how Spider Woman gave special powers to Monster-Slayer and his sister Child-Born-of-Water, to help them in their quest to find their long-lost father, Sun-God. Then when the family was triumphantly reunited, Sun-God showed his children how to destroy all the evil monsters forever, so the Navajo could live in peace and harmony.Unfortunately Julia and her daughter would never be able to quell their own demons and find peace.&nbsp;<br>Julia Scully was born in Twin Lakes on February 12, 1943, the youngest child of Miriam and Sam Bowman. She grew up with her three brothers and two sisters in the spectacular red-rock, deep-canyoned New Mexico side of the twenty-four-thousand-square-mile reservation, bordering the states of Utah, Colorado and Arizona.The two-hundred-thousand-strong Navajo people is the largest Indian nation in the United States and had suffered greatly since the Spanish first colonized their lands in the 15th century. It was a tortured history drenched in blood, leaving an indelible mark on each member of the tribe to this day.The white invaders introduced sheep and horses to the Navajo, who soon used the animals for their nomadic way of life. They became excellent horsemen and began raiding the Spanish settlements in revenge.But once the United States defeated Spain and assumed control of the vast tribal lands, the army used extreme brutality to tame the Navajo. It was a dark time for the Navajo nation as they were systematically robbed of their lands by the legendary Kit Carson, who burned their villages, slaughtering hundreds of men, women and children.By 1864 most of the Navajo nation had been defeatedand the United States government decided to forcibly move the tribe from the Four Sacred Mountains to Fort Sumner, three hundred miles east. During what has become known as the "Long Walk," more than two hundred Navajos perished from starvation and the inhuman conditions they encountered during their compulsory exodus through the burning desert.The survivors were imprisoned in Fort Sumner, where they were herded into the barren land, which was unable to support their cattle and crops. Any Navajo who tried to escape back to their homeland were hunted down and ruthlessly killed by the army.After four torturous years, which saw hundreds of Navajo die from starvation, the Federal Government signed a new treaty in 1868. This allowed the tribe to return to their beloved Four Sacred Mountains, where they remain to this day. For the last one hundred and thirty years the proud tribe has eked out a living, raising sheep and selling its unique crafts, including rugs, jewelry and silverwork.Julia's father Sam Bowman was born in 1895 on the reservation near Shiprock, New Mexico. He had married and had four children before his wife died as a young woman.In the early 1930s during a visit to Twin Lakes, New Mexico, Sam met a beautiful young woman named Miriam, who was fifteen years younger than him. They soon fell in love and after marrying in a traditional ceremony, Sam remained in Twin Lakes to live near Miriam's family.Sam began raising goats and sheep to support his new wife, who used the wool to weave intricate rugs in the traditional Navajo style for sale to tourists. During the summer they grew fruit and vegetables, and were self-sufficient.Sam Bowman's entire family, consisting of grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins all lived in the same village in traditional Navajo houses, called hogans, within a few yards of each other.Over the years, Sam and Miriam had six children and it was often a struggle to survive, but the children never went hungry and were always well-clothed. Times were hard as the twentieth-century Navajos slowly assimilated into the American system, still retaining their ancient traditions and way of life.There were few jobs on the reservation and Sam Bowman's cattle business was highly precarious, given frequent droughts and extremes in temperatures. The long summers were brutally hot, bringing dust storms, and in the winter the temperatures plunged to freezing and often brought snow.To protect his family and his cattle, Sam and his brother used their own hands to dig a simple shelter in a nearby hill to protect them from the cold. One of Julia's earliest memories is of lying in the dug-out with the cattle to keep warm on the long winter nights, listening to her mother's stories of the ancient Navajo folklore."But in the summertime, no matter how hot it was, it was always cool in there," remembers Julia.Life was tough on the reservation in the 1950s with no electricity or running water. Alcoholism was a major problem as more and more Navajo turned to drink in order to escape the growing pressures of modern life. The environment Julia grew up in, and her father's strict discipline, would have a lasting effect on the young girl after she made her own way in the world.When she was twelve, Julia, who spoke fluent Navajo, was sent away to an Indian boarding school inBrigham City, Utah, to learn to read and write in English."I hadn't realized that there was a world outside," says Julia. "It was the first time I had ever left the reservation."Always headstrong and independent, the pretty, dark-haired Julia hated the rules and restrictions that were imposed on her. And after a couple of years at the boarding school, she told her parents she wasn't going back.Sam and Miriam were sympathetic and arranged for her to go to another boarding school for American Indian children near Carson City, Nevada. But the adventurous girl longed to see more of the world outside the reservation.So when she was sixteen, she took a three-month summer job in Sacramento, California, caring for two little boys as a mother's helper. When her new employers flew to New York to celebrate their wedding anniversary, Julia took the boys to stay with their grandparents in San Francisco.It was the first time Julia had ever been in a big city, with its modern skyscrapers and frenetic way of life. She found it a revelation and, with a mixture of excitement and fear, timidly explored her new surroundings, resolving to leave the reservation at the earliest possible opportunity."They lived on the seventeenth floor," she recalls, "and they had a patio but I was so scared I wouldn't even go out."Every day, when the boys were napping, Julia timidly ventured out of the building to walk to the street corner. There she would stand entranced for hours, watching the non-stop stream of traffic and pedestrians, dreaming ofliving in such a wondrous place where anything seemed possible.The following year she took another summer job caring for a rich couple's children in the desert oasis of Lake Tahoe in Nevada. It was another life-changing experience for the teenager, who loved the excitement of the gambling mecca, even though she never set foot inside a casino.When Julia graduated from school, she told her parents she would not be returning to the reservation. Her mother was very concerned for her youngest daughter, knowing the prejudice that she would encounter in the outside world. Besides, no one else in their family had ever wanted to leave the reservation before."I guess I was the only one who wanted to go and see other things," said Julia. "There was nothing really to keep me on the reservation. But my mother said it would be all right as long as I was happy."&nbsp;<br>In 1961, at the age of eighteen, Julia Bowman moved to Reno, Nevada, with stars in her eyes. She soon found a job as a hospital aide and began finding her feet. At first she made frequent trips home to visit her parents but she never stayed long, itching to return to her exciting new life in the glamourous casino town.Two years later Sam Bowman was diagnosed with diabetes and Julia dutifully went back to Twin Lakes to help care for him. But the following spring she left again, this time heading east to Colorado Springs, where she found a job as a dietary assistant in a private hospital for the mentally ill.Every Tuesday some of the patients would receive electroconvulsive therapy. As part of her job, Julia prepared their special diet trays for when they came out ofthe treatment. It was a terrible ordeal for the sensitive young girl to witness the misery of the patients first-hand, as she fed them.It was here that Julia was first introduced to amphetamines by a female friend at the hospital. One day at a friend's apartment she was given a glass of iced tea which had been laced with speed. Before long Julia was addicted to amphetamines."The thing with the pills was that I could stay up for forty-eight hours," she said. "But although I would become really irritable, I always wanted to do them."Her friend had a prescription for the diet pills with no restrictions for refills, so Julia went to the drug store to buy supplies. She found speed helped her get through her tough job as well as to stay up late.There was an active social scene among the hospital staff she met in the canteen. A couple of times a week she would join her new friends for a night out in the lively bars in Colorado Springs, where they drank heavily. And the friendly, attractive Indian girl proved very popular and was often asked out on dates.On July 4, 1964, she was celebrating Independence Day in a bar when she was introduced to a tall, handsome military policeman named John Scully, who was stationed at nearby Fort Carson on a two-year round of service.Born in Philadelphia, Scully was twenty-five years old and his background was worlds apart from Julia's. A soft-spoken conservative young man enjoying his stint out West in the military, he didn't appear to have much in common with the full-blooded Navajo girl, but John was captivated by her dark exotic beauty and there was an immediate physical attraction between them.They got off to a bad start when Scully told her theyhad met a few weeks earlier when he was dating one of her friends, and Julia couldn't remember. But after breaking the ice, he asked her out the following Saturday, she agreed. Within a week they were courting.However, the relationship had to be put on hold when John had to go back to Philadelphia for a couple of months. Upon his return he immediately telephoned Julia and on one of their first dates surprised her by proposing marriage. She agreed."I was just a kid," said Julia. "We were at a party when he suddenly announced he always knew we would be married. It had never even occurred to me."A couple of weeks later Julia returned to the reservation with the news of her engagement. Her parents were concerned that it was too soon for her to marry but reluctantly gave their blessing, saying they were happy if this was what she wanted.John and Julia were married in a simple Catholic ceremony in Colorado Springs on July 2, 1965. They moved into a small apartment but were too poor to go on a proper honeymoon.Soon after they were married John completed his military service and found a construction job. But just after Labor Day he told his new wife that they were moving east, across the country to Philadelphia. He explained that the seasonal construction work in Colorado Springs had come to an end, and there were far more job opportunities to pursue in Philadelphia.Julia feared such a big move and being two thousand miles away from her family, but John assured her that if she was not happy they would move back again."I didn't have any choice," says Julia. "He knew exactly what he wanted so I finally said OK."Julia insisted that John first come back to Twin Lakesto meet her family and spend a few days on the reservation. It would be five years before Julia went home again, and the last time she would ever see her father alive.&nbsp;<br>John and Julia Scully arrived in Philadelphia in the midst of one of the coldest winters on record. They moved into a small row house in the staunchly working-class north Philadelphia suburb of Kensington, also known as Fishtown. Once the textile capital of the United States, Kensington was now a drab, gray place littered with mills and factories, spewing thick black smoke high into the air. It was a long way away from the scenic wide-open spaces Julia had grown up in. She found it very hard to adapt and missed her family terribly."I didn't know anyone except my husband," she remembers. "It was very hard and I was homesick."In the close-knit neighborhood where everyone knew one another, the pretty Navajo girl stood out and was often mistaken for Filipino or Korean. Although the neighbors were friendly enough to her face, Julia always felt she was being looked down upon.They settled down on the same street as John Scully's parents, just two blocks away from John's twin brother Joseph. Julia did her best to make a good impression when she was first introduced to his family, but it would take many months before she was accepted.Soon after they arrived John applied to join the Philadelphia Police Department. While he was waiting for the results his brother Joseph found him a job in a refrigeration plant. Julia also found a job in a shoe factory, doing menial piece work to supplement their income.John was delighted when he heard that he had passed the application test. On February 6, 1966, he officiallyjoined the Philadelphia Police Department as a beat cop in the tough Seventh Precinct on Bustleton and Bower Street in north Philadelphia. Although the job paid well, his shifts alternated between days and nights. It was tough on Julia, who found herself alone at home most nights, and she became even more homesick.But everything changed in the spring of 1967 when she found out she was pregnant. Julia was delighted at the prospect of a baby, believing it would give her a new purpose in life. Now she would have company to occupy her time. She began preparing for motherhood by buying baby clothes, while John set up a nursery in an upstairs room.Finally Julia was beginning to settle down in Philadelphia and seemed to be happy and content. But it was a rare period of peace in the Scullys' marriage, which would soon burst apart at the seams with terrible consequences.Copyright � 2000 by John Glatt.</p><h2>Cape Light: Color Photographs by Joel Meyerowitz</h2><p>Originally published in 1979, &#34;Cape Light&#34; became an instant classic and one of the most influential photography books published in the latter part of the 20th century.

Caught between the giants of the Soviet Union and the Third Reich, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia became pawns in the desperate battle for control of Eastern Europe throughout the course of World War II. This is a story of conquest and exploitation, of death and deportation and the fight for survival both by countries and individuals. The three states were repeatedly occupied -- by the Soviet Union in 1939, by Germany in 1941, and again by the Soviet Union in 1944-45. In each case, local government organizations and individuals were forced to choose between supporting the occupying forces or forming partisan units. Many would be caught up in the bitter fighting in the region and, in particular, in the huge battles for the Courland bridgehead during Operation <i>Bagration</i> when hundreds of thousands of soldiers would fight and die in the last year of the war. Over 300,000 Soviet troops would be lost during the repeated assaults on the 'Courland Cauldron' before 146,000 German and Latvia troops were finally forced to surrender. No mercy was shown and all Latvians, Lithuanians, and Estonians who fought for Germany were executed. By the end of the war, death and deportation had cost the Baltic States over 20 percent of their total population and the iron curtain would descend on the region for over four decades. Using numerous first-hand accounts and detailed archival research, Prit Buttar weaves a magisterial account of the bitter fighting on the Eastern Front and the three small states whose fates were determined by the fortunes and misfortunes of war.</p><p>Prit Buttar studied medicine at Oxford and London before joining the British Army as a doctor. After leaving the army, he has worked as a GP, first near Bristol and now in Abingdon near Oxford. He is extensively involved in medical politics, both at local and national level, and serves on the GPs' Committee of the British Medical Association. He appears from time to time on local and national TV and radio, speaking on a variety of medical issues. He contributes regularly to the medical press. An expert on the Eastern Front during World War II, he previously wrote the critically acclaimed <i>Battleground Prussia: The Assault on Germany's Eastern Front 1944-45</i> (Osprey 2010).<p>&#x201c;[A] carefully balanced account of the predicament in which Balts found themselves...Mr. Buttar is himself an army veteran, and it is from the military perspective that he relates the savage unraveling of the Baltic world during World War II's last year. There's plenty here on weaponry, on tactics and strategy.&#x201d; <b><i>Andrew Stuttaford, The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"A magisterial account, <i>Between Giants </i>does not attempt to judge the decisions made by the leaders and the people of the Baltic States, who struggled to reconcile the situation in which they found themselves with their own aspirations. It elucidates the terrible destruction and bloodshed that had such a devastating effect on this corner of Europe, the consequences of which are still felt today."<br>- Savannah Jones, www.sirreadalot.org<br><br>"By magnificently mining and marshaling sources, Buttar potently recaps this tragic chapter in Baltic history.&nbsp; Serious students of WWII's Eastern Front should make Osprey's terrific tome required reading."<br>- David E.

He describes craft as uniquely blending function with a deeper expression of human values that transcend culture, time, and space. Craft must articulate a role for itself in contemporary society, says Risatti; otherwise it will be absorbed by fine art or design, and its singular approach to understanding the world will be lost.<br><br></p><p>"An unprecedented effort to define crafts and to place the work in a cultural context, both differentiating it from and aligning it with other aesthetic activities.

He became a respected member of the Irish Home Office and an expert on criminal investigation. In 1888, he was summoned to Scotland Yard, London, to serve as Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, an office he filled with distinction until retirement in 1896. At his retirement, he was knighted by Queen Victoria; and in 1901, King Edward VII made him Knight Commander. In the midst of all his many duties, he managed to gain a profound knowledge of the Bible, preach in various conferences, and write seventeen books.</p><h2>Salad Leaves For All Seasons: Organic Growing from Pot to Plot</h2><p><p>This compendium of practical methods for growing a wide variety of salads throughout the year will inspire you to grow your own greens, whether on a windowsill, in your garden, or on your allotment.

With <i>American Genius,</i> her first novel since 1998's <i>No Lease on Life,</i> she shows what might happen if Jane Austen were writing in 21st-century America. Employing her trademark crystalline prose and intricate, hypnotic sentences, Tillman fashions a microcosm of American democracy: a scholarly colony functioning like Melville&#x2019;s <i>Pequod</i>. In this otherworld, competing values rationality and irrationality, generosity and selfishness, love and lust, shame and honor collide through a witty narrative, cycling through such disparate tropes as skin disease, chair design, and Manifest Destiny. All this is folded into the narrator&#x2019;s memories and emotional life, culminating in a s�ance that may offer escape and transcendence or perhaps nothing. Grand and minute, elegiac and hilarious, Lynne Tillman expands the possibilities of the American novel in this dazzling read.</p><p>An often dazzling, totally disorienting interior riff, Tillman's fifth novel (after 1995's <i>Haunted Houses</i>) presents an unnamed woman of a certain age, who lingers in a spa (or is it a madhouse?), digressing with authority on loneliness, denim, Eames chairs, the history of silk, the vicissitudes of friendship, Puritanism, the blissfulness of sleep and the pleasures of 100% cotton socks. Dialogue is virtually absent, as is plot; most everything&#x2014;a painful childhood, beloved pets, a dead father and brother and a troubled mother&#x2014;is revealed through the woman's first-person recollections and observations. Eventually, it appears the narrator is resident in a New Age, claustrophobia-inducing colony, where she sharply observes her strange fellows and attends absurd guest lectures ("Live Food, Raw Food"). The location and purpose remain ambiguous, as do large chunks of the narrator's personal history, which has left her with an obsession with skin: leg waxing, alopecia, psoriasis, facials (a particular favorite) and scars "whose presence never lets you forget the event, which may have been dramatic or even traumatic." Indeed, her own memories seem to have left her suffering, numb and loquacious. Vividly recorded by the multitalented Tillman (who also writes nonfiction, essays and short stories), this loopy trip through a meandering, fretful mind proves worthwhile. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After defining the problems, the author proposes models and solutions for some age-old dilemmas. Here are just some of the more than two dozen major questions that are discussed: What makes the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament authoritative for the church? How much continuity and discontinuity is there between the Old and New Testaments? Did the Old Testament writers consciously anticipate the Messiah? Were the object and method of salvation the same in both Testaments? What was the Old Testament believer&#x2019;s experience of the Holy Spirit? How can Christians teach or preach form the prophetic portions of the Old Testament? What is the challenge of the Old Testament for missions? According to Dr. Kaiser, understanding the Old Testament is the crucial problem for the Christian. Hardly an area in the Christian life, Christian doctrine, and biblical studies is not affected by one&#x2019;s understanding of the Old Testament. This book is a forceful demonstration of that truth. It deals with some of the crucial topics necessary to a proper and practical interpretation and application of the Old Testament and discusses them in three parts: (1) The Old Testament and Scholarship, (2) The Old Testament and Theology, and (3) The Old Testament and Life.</p></p><p>Walter C.

Spanning two decades, <i>Driving Home</i> charts a course through the Pacific Northwest, American history, and current events as witnessed by &#x201c;a super-sensitive, all-seeing eye. Raban spots things we might otherwise miss; he calls up the apt metaphors that transform things into phenomena. He is one of our most gifted observers&#x201d; (<i>Newsday</i>).<br>&nbsp;<br>Stops en route include a Missoula bar, a Tea Party convention in Nashville hosted by Sarah Palin, the Mississippi in full flood, a trip to Hawaii with his daughter, a steelhead river in the Cascades, and the hidden corners of his adopted hometown, Seattle. He deftly explores public and personal spaces, poetry and politics, geography and catastrophe, art and economy, and the shifts in various arenas that define our society. Whether the topic is Robert Lowell or Barack Obama, or how various painters, explorers, and homesteaders have engaged with our mythical and actual landscape, he has an outsider&#x2019;s eye for the absurd, and his tone is intimate, never nostalgic, and always fresh.<br>&nbsp;<br>Frank, witty, and provocative, <i>Driving Home</i> is part essay collection, part diary&#x2014;and irresistibly insightful about America&#x2019;s character, contradictions, and idiosyncrasies.</p></p><p><p><b>Jonathan Raban</b> is the author, most recently, of the novels <i>Surveillance</i> and <i>Waxwings; </i>his nonfiction includes <i>Passage to Juneau</i> and <i>Bad Land.</i> His honors include the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/West Creative Nonfiction Award, the Pacific Northwest Booksellers&#x2019; Award, and the Governor&#x2019;s Award of the State of Washington. He lives in Seattle.</p><p>Driving Home <br>&nbsp;<br>In the spring of 1990 I packed up as much of my life in London as would fit into a suitcase and four large plywood boxes and flew to Seattle to set up house. It was a selfish and irregular move. I had &#x201c;met someone&#x201d; and liked what I&#x2019;d seen of the Pacific Northwest during a two-month stay there the previous autumn. I liked the aquarium lighting, the sawtooth alps forested with black firs, the compact cities encrusted in dirty Roman�esque stucco. Most of all, I liked the place&#x2019;s wateriness. At forty-seven I felt cracked and dry. My new home territory was as rainy as Ireland, puddled with lakes and veined with big rivers. Seattle was built out on pilings over the sea, and at high tide the whole city seemed to come afloat like a ship lifting free from a mud berth and swaying in its chains. <br><br>We took a house on the wrong side of Queen Anne, the innermost of Seattle&#x2019;s hilltop suburbs. The tall wooden house, built like a boat from mas�sive scantlings of Douglas fir, carvel-planked with cedar, had been put up in 1906, in the wake of the Yukon gold rush, when the hill itself was logged. It had warped and settled through a string of minor earthquakes: the floors sloped, doors hung askew in their frames, and on a silent night it groaned and whiffled like a sleeping dog. <br><br>Barely a mile from the new banking and insurance skyscrapers of down�town, the house felt as if it were hidden away in the woods. Shaggy conifers, survivors of the original forest, darkened the views from every window. The study looked down over the Ship Canal, where trawlers stalked through an avenue of poplars on their start to the Alaskan fi shing grounds, eight hundred miles to the north. From the top-floor deck one could see out over the pale suburbs, like shell-middens, to the serrated line of the Cascade Mountains, still snow-capped in May. <br><br>For someone fresh off the plane from London, it was a vast prospect in which making oneself at home would not be easy. It had been fine to be a tourist in this landscape, when I had been enjoyably awed by its far-western heights and distances; but now that I&#x2019;d signed up as a permanent resident, the view from the window seemed only to reflect my own displacement. <br><br>Even the very near-at-hand was strange. I kept Peterson&#x2019;s <i>Western Birds </i>and the <i>Audubon Guide to Western Forests</i> by the typewriter. I made lists and pinned them to the wall. <i>Cedar, cypress, dogwood, laurel, madrona maple,</i> I wrote, trying to distinguish individual personalities in the jumble of damp and muddy greens framed by the window. I took the tree book down to the garden and, wary of attracting derisive looks from the neigh�bors, matched the real-life barks against their close-up color pictures; the peeling, fish-scale skin of the lodgepole pine, the frayed hemp rope of the western red cedar. It took a month, at least, to be able to see the black-crested Steller&#x2019;s jay in the madrona with something like the comfort�able indifference with which I&#x2019;d used to notice a song thrush in the syca�more in Battersea. It took a good deal longer to adjust to how adeptly the rufous hummingbird, like a tiny thrashing autogyro, redisposed itself in space, zapping from point to point too fast for the eye to follow. Glancing up from the typewriter, stuck for a phrase, I&#x2019;d catch sight of a bald eagle slowly circling on a thermal over the Ship Canal, its huge wings still and ragged, and lose the logic of the sentence to another half hour of involun�tary ornithology. <br><br>The German word for &#x201c;uncanny,&#x201d; as in Freud&#x2019;s famous essay on the Uncanny, is <i>unheimlich</i>&#x2014;unhomely. The tourist thrives on the uncanny, moving happily through a phenomenal world of effects without causes. This world, in which he has no experience and no memory, is presented to him as a supernatural domain: the language of travel advertising hawks the uncanny as part of the deal. Experience the <i>magic</i> of Bali! The <i>wonders</i> of Hawaii! The <i>enchantment</i> of Bavaria! <br><br>But for the newly arrived immigrant, this magic stuff is like a curse. He&#x2019;s faced at every turn with the unhomelikeness of things, in an uncanny realm where the familiar house sparrows have all fled, to be replaced by hum�mingbirds and eagles. The immigrant needs to grow a memory, and grow it fast. Somehow or other, he must learn to convert the uncanny into the homely, in order to find a stable footing in the new land. <br><br>Hunkered down in the second-floor study of the comfortingly old and memorious house on Queen Anne, I tried to read my way home. My best guides were fellow aliens in the Pacific Northwest, from the early explorers of the region to such relatively recent arrivals here as the poet Theodore Roethke and the novelist Bernard Malamud. From the late eighteenth cen�tury to the late twentieth, they kept striking the same note of shock at the stupendous unhomelikeness of this landscape. <br>&nbsp;<br>##<br>It drove George Vancouver into a pit of what now appears to have been clinical depression. Between May and June of 1792, as he probed the inlets of Washington and British Columbia, he went from dizzy elation to sullen melancholy&#x2014;and wrote his changing moods into the permanent nomen�clature of the region. To begin with, he was high on his discoveries: this was &#x201c;the most lovely country that can be imagined.&#x201d; He saw the Pacific North�west as a kind of unusually verdant Devonshire, and imagined orderly vil�lages with churches and manors laid out between the wooded hills. At this stage of the voyage, the names he gave to the headlands, bays, and fiords were upbeat: Discovery Bay, Protection Island, Restoration Point (the most beautiful and useful features, like Mount Rainier and Port Townsend, were named by Vancouver after his relations, friends, and patrons). <br><br>May turned into June. As Vancouver sailed north, the mountains grew steeper, the inlets narrower, the woods more impenetrable. His lieutenant, Peter Puget, who kept a parallel journal, was increasingly excited by the romantic sublimity of what he saw: a few years younger than Vancouver, he was much more in tune with the rising generation&#x2019;s taste for wild nature. For Puget, the unfolding landscape was &#x201c;majestic&#x201d; and full of &#x201c;grandeur&#x201d;; for Vancouver it was increasingly &#x201c;dreary,&#x201d; &#x201c;unpleasant,&#x201d; &#x201c;desolate,&#x201d; &#x201c;gloomy,&#x201d; &#x201c;dismal,&#x201d; and &#x201c;awful&#x201d;&#x2014;the words pepper his descriptions, often being used twice in the same sentence. Five minutes north of the fi ftieth parallel, Vancouver brought his ship to a &#x201c;dreary and unpleasant anchor�age&#x201d;: &#x201c;Our residence here was truly forlorn; an awful silence pervaded the gloomy forests, whilst animated nature seemed to have deserted the neigh�bouring country . . . &#x201d; He called the place Desolation Sound. <br><br>Thirteen years after the Vancouver expedition, in the autumn of 1805, Lewis and Clark reached the Columbia River valley from the continen�tal interior, after climbing to the headwaters of the Missouri and crossing the Rocky Mountains in what is now Montana. William Clark, with his botched spellings and childish exclamation marks, was a resoundingly lively presence on the page. He was an original vernacular narrator as he confi ded his discomforts, Dear Diary&#x2013;style, to his journal. &#x201c;O! how horriable is the day&#x2014;&#x201d; he wrote when the tidal Columbia cut up rough in a westerly gale and waves drenched the explorers&#x2019; camp. &#x201c;We are all wet and disagreeable.&#x201d; Clark had grown up in Virginia and Kentucky, and, like almost every new�comer to the Northwest, was incredulous at the monotonous fall rains that soaked the country west of the Cascades. It rained day after day, hour after hour&#x2014; with the fine-sifted thoroughness and regularity of a gigantic lawn sprinkler. &#x201c;This morning Cloudy and drisley.&#x201d; &#x201c;Rained all the last night we are all wet.&#x201d; &#x201c;Rain as usual.&#x201d; &#x201c;Rained without intermition.&#x201d; &#x201c;A blustering rainey day.&#x201d; &#x201c;A hard rain all the last night we again get wet.&#x201d; &#x201c;Rained verry hard.&#x201d; &#x201c;Confined on a tempiest coast, wet.&#x201d; The swollen river carried with it the trunks of uprooted trees, &#x201c;maney of them nearly 200 feet long&#x201d;; as they spun around and around on the current, they often came close to cap�sizing the expedition&#x2019;s canoes. &#x201c;Those monsterous trees&#x2014;&#x201d; wrote Clark, summoning the vocabulary of the uncanny to convey the gross abundance of this landscape. <br><br>In 1947 Theodore Roethke came west to Seattle, drawn here by the offer of a job in the English department at the University of Washington. The city itself (&#x201c;a kind of vast Scarsdale . . . no bars for anything except beer and light wines in the whole of Seattle&#x201d;) was tame and provincial, but the sur�rounding landscape roused Roethke, as it had roused Vancouver, to flights of concentrated pathetic fallacy. Before 1947, his poems had been full of emotional turmoil projected onto a vivid vegetable world of crocuses, gera�niums, cyclamens, peaches, butternuts, pear trees, and spiders&#x2014;a world enclosed by the same fences that bordered his father&#x2019;s market garden and nursery in Saginaw, Michigan. In the Pacific Northwest (&#x201c; . . . the peaks, the black ravines, the rolling mists / Changing with every twist of wind . . . &#x201d;) Roethke found a nature that was extravagant enough to give physical body to the extremes of his own morbidly dishevelled nature. <br><br>His new poems mapped a wild, volcanic, thickly forested region of the heart and mind. In the geological melodrama of the Washington landscape, he found a spectacular objective correlative to the upheavals of his mental life&#x2014;the uncontrollable ascents into mania, the whiskey, the compulsive womanizing. His last collection, <i>The Far Field,</i> posthumously published in 1964, is an inspired gazetteer of places that are simultaneously states of mind and visitable destinations within easy reach of Seattle. &#x201c;Journey to the Interior,&#x201d; for instance, is both a fine description of driving on a logging trail in the Cascades (Roethke bought his first car, a Buick, in 1950, when he was forty-two and was thereafter an enthusiastic&#x2014;and alarming&#x2014;motorist) and a lightly encoded account of a life spent skirting the edge of insanity: <br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>In the long journey out of the self, </i><br><i>There are many detours, washed-out interrupted raw places </i><br><i>Where the shale slides dangerously </i><br><i>And the back wheels hang almost over the edge . . . </i><br>&nbsp;<br>As the mountains represented the menacing heights, the rivers, lakes, and sea afforded renewal and balm. Roethke wrote beautifully about water, its movements and stillnesses. In the mental hospital, he spent long hours in hydrotherapy; sane, he found another kind of hydrotherapy, fishing for coho salmon from the Oyster River resort on the east coast of Vancouver Island, watching birds on Lake Washington, walking on the rocky margin of Puget Sound, watching small waves break. From &#x201c;The Rose&#x201d;: <br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>I live with the rocks, their weeds, </i><br><i>Their filmy fringes of green, their harsh </i><br><i>Edges, their holes </i><br><i>Cut by the sea-slime, far from the crash </i><br><i>Of the long swell, </i><br><i>The oily, tar-laden walls </i><br><i>Of the toppling waves, </i><br><i>Where the salmon ease their way into the kelp beds, </i><br><i>And the sea rearranges itself among the small islands. </i><br><i>Near this rose, in this grove of sun-parched, wind-warped madronas, </i><br><i>Among the half-dead trees, I came upon the true ease of myself, </i><br><i>As if another man appeared out of the depth of my being . . . </i><br>&nbsp;<br>It was exciting to watch Roethke making himself at home in western Wash�ington by discovering that western Washington had always, as it were, been inside himself. To the view that I could see from my own window, Roethke attached names and meanings that went far deeper than Vancouver&#x2019;s. Of all the incomers to the Northwest, who had put this landscape to use and made cognitive sense of it, from fur traders and timber barons to aeronauti�cal engineers and Dutch bulb-growers, Roethke was the most generous: if a stranger had as baggage nothing except Roethke&#x2019;s <i>Collected Poems,</i> he would have a solid imaginative foothold here. <br>&nbsp;<br>##<br>In 1949, Bernard Malamud left New York to take a job as an instructor in the English department at Oregon State College in Corvallis, lately an agri�cultural school. In 1961, he returned to the East Coast, where he had been appointed writer- in- residence at Bennington College in Vermont&#x2014;and published his third novel, <i>A New Life,</i> a bitter comedy about a New York Jew, an English instructor, who finds himself stranded in a narrow-minded town in the wide-open country of the Pacific Northwest. Malamud&#x2019;s revenge on Oregon (as it was generally perceived by Oregonians) had for a long time been my favorite campus novel&#x2014;though for years I believed that it was set in an invented landscape, a fabulous Far West that Malamud had cooked up in his Manhattan fastness. <br><br>I had come across the book in 1964, in the paperback carousel at the new service station at Newport Pagnell on the M1 motorway. The cover was suggestive. Above the blurb, &#x201c;He found strange refuge&#x2014;love with another man&#x2019;s wife,&#x201d; was a drawing of a young woman reaching for the zip of her Levi&#x2019;s. The man in the background was small and wore a hat. I knew Mal�amud&#x2019;s name from the stylized short stories of New York Jewish life in <i>Idiots First.</i> I hadn&#x2019;t heard of this surprising novel. <br><br>I read it in a sitting and have owned three separate copies since, but it wasn&#x2019;t until around the beginning of the second copy that I woke up to the fact that Malamud&#x2019;s &#x201c;Cascadia&#x201d; was Oregon, not an urban Jewish fantasy of some Eden far beyond the range of the road atlas. I hadn&#x2019;t then been to the United States, and the landscape described by Malamud&#x2014;a green paradise infected by the encroaching spectre of Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x2014;rang no specific bells for me. It read like the landscape of allegory, and worked so well in those terms that I wasn&#x2019;t tempted to go looking for its latitude and longitude. <br><br>In the book, Marathon, Cascadia, is a rigidly conformist college cow-town, with a winning football team and a paranoid contempt for Reds, misfits, and intellectuals. Seymour Levin, &#x201c;from the East,&#x201d; &#x201c;formerly a drunkard,&#x201d; an admitted liberal with a beard, is destined for a painful roast�ing in this 1950s version of a Puritan township enjoying a witch trial. At every turn in the story, the philistinism and uncharitableness of town and college are set against a landscape of mountains, forest, and ocean so ironi�cally magnificent that any reader bred to the landscape of Newport Pagnell must have doubted its literal existence. <i>A New Life</i> seemed to me to be written in the freehand, fantastic tradition of the Jewish folktale: Malamud was painting the richness and promise of the idea of America&#x2014;and its betrayal by a mean-spirited citizenry, people too small to deserve to inherit their gigantic land. <br><br>It slightly diminished the novel to learn that there were &#x201c;originals&#x201d; (or so my knowing American informant claimed) of the Fairchilds, the C. D. Fab�rikants, the Buckets and Bullocks, and that Malamud&#x2019;s poisoned Arcadia was drawn directly from the life&#x2014;that Marathon was Corvallis, sixty-five miles down the road from Portland. This American, a Berkeley professor, thought I was offbeam when I claimed the novel was a work of ambitious fabulism.

His notoriety has rested almost entirely on his role as Secretary of the Treasury in Washington's administration, yet few realize that Washington and Hamilton's bond was forged during the Revolutionary War. <i>Alexander Hamilton's Revolution</i> is the first book to explore Hamilton's critical role during the battle for independence. New information presents a little-known and underpublished aspect of Hamilton's life: that he was not only Washington's favorite staff officer, but also his right-hand man for most of the Revolution, serving as Chief of Staff from 1777 to early 1781.<br> While he found this position rewarding, Hamilton continually asked Washington for a field command. Hamilton's wish was granted at the decisive battle of Yorktown, where his Infantry Battalion charged on the defensive bastion on Cornwallis's left flank. Hamilton's capture of this position, while French forced captured the adjacent position, sealed Cornwallis's fate and forced his surrender and ultimate colonial victory.<br> The entire patriotic cause benefited immeasurably from the advice and strategies provided to Washington by his youngest staff officer, Alexander Hamilton. Now, those critical contributions are brought to light in <i>Hamilton's Revolution</i>.</p><p><b>Phillip Thomas Tucker, PhD</b>, is the author of the acclaimed Skyhorse books <i>George Washington's Surprise Attack</i>, <i>How the Irish Won the American Revolution</i>, <i>Pickett's Charge</i>, and <i>Death at the Little Bighorn</i>.

Levi Bellfield is one of the most notorious British serial killers of the last fifty years&#x2014;his name alone evokes horror and revulsion, after his string of brutal murders in the early 2000s. At 3:07pm on 21st March, 2002, Milly Dowler left her school in Surrey for the last time. Less than an hour later, she was to be abducted and murdered in the cruellest fashion, sparking a missing person investigation that would span months before her body was found. In the two years that followed, two more young women&#x2014;Marsha McDonnell and then Am�lie Delagrange&#x2014;were murdered in unspeakably brutal attacks. Yet with three murdered women on their hands, and few leads open to them, investigating officers were running out of ideas and options, until SIO Colin Sutton was drafted into the investigation for the murder of Delagrange. Seeing a connection between the three women, and thriving under the pressure of a serial killer hunt, Sutton was finally able to bring their murderer to justice after the case had begun to seem hopeless. Manhunt tells the story of how he led the charge to find a mystery killer, against the clock and against the odds - day by day and lead by lead. At once a gripping police procedural, and an insight into the life of an evil man, this is the story behind what it takes to track down a shockingly violent murderer before he strikes again.</p><p><b>Colin Sutton</b> was drafted into the investigation for the murder of Delagrange when investigating officers were running out of ideas and options.

Originally published in 1923 - translated into more than 20 languages. With 12 full page drawings by Gibran.</p><p>In a distant, timeless place, a mysterious prophet walks the sands. At the moment of his departure, he wishes to offer the people gifts but possesses nothing. The people gather round, each asks a question of the heart, and the man's wisdom is his gift. It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description "divinely inspired." Free of dogma, free of power structures and metaphysics, consider these poetic, moving aphorisms a 20th-century supplement to all sacred traditions--as millions of other readers already have. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Almustafa, the chosen and the beloved, who was a dawn unto his own day, had waited twelve years in the city of Orphalese for his ship that was to return and bear him back to the isle of his birth.</p><h2>Malcolm X</h2><p>Records the life of the martyred black American who became world famous as a spokesman for his people</p><p><p>Arnold Adoff has written over twenty-five books of poetry for young readers, including <em>Slow Dance Heartbreak Blues,</em> illustrated by William Cotton; and <em>Street Music: City Poems,</em> illustrated by Karen Barbour, both of which are available at your local library.

As Bilbo Baggins takes his final voyage to the Undying Lands, he must say goodbye to Middle-earth. Poignant and lyrical, the song is both a longing to set forth on his ultimate journey and a tender farewell to friends left behind.<br> Pauline Baynes&#x2019;s jewel-like illustrations lushly depict both this final voyage and scenes from <i>The Hobbit</i>, as Bilbo remembers his first journey while he prepares for his last.</p><p>J.R.R. Tolkien was the beloved author of <i>The Hobbit</i> and the masterpiece trilogy <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. He died in 1973 at the age of 81.Grade 5 Up-- An illustrated version of a small poem from the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. The poem, in which Bilbo talks about leaving Middle Earth and bidding farewell to his life and friends there, is a vehicle for Baynes to immerse herself in the characters and events in this trilogy. The pages are filled with watercolor drawings skillfully depicting detailed scenes of great adventure--magical beings with glistening capes, sparkling rings, and other mystical objects that convey all the wonder and charm of Tolkien. Unfortunately, none of these wonderfully detailed drawings illustrate the words in this book. In fact, they were not intended to do so. Instead, they depict scenes from The Hobbit, The Return of the King, or The Fellowship of the Ring , necessitating complex explanatory notes for all of the illustrations, even the endpapers. The result is not a blending of pictures and words or even a picture book version of a children's poem, but a study of Tolkien--overwhelming for any reader unfamiliar with his work. Although this book pays tribute to him, it suffers from an excess of praise and loses its audience as a result. Most children would only be confused by it. --Jane Marino, White Plains Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Petty Pewter Gods: A Garrett, P.I.

Fighting his way through Mexico, rinky-dink leagues and a battery of thieving, sleazy promoters/managers, the book ended with the author's WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) debut. Never one to leave his fans hanging, as demonstrated by his recent return to wrestling glory, Jericho now tells the story of life in the big leagues. But "making it" in the premier wrestling league in the world comes with its own set of obstacles and hard lessons. Jericho, in his witty, hilarious, and surprisingly endearing manner, lays it all out: the good, the bad, and the spandex.</p><p>Chris Jericho is universally regarded as one of the best pro wrestlers in history and one of the greatest talkers in the business. His first autobiography <em>A Lion's Tale</em> was a <em>New York Times</em> besteller. Chris was also the host of the ABC game show <em>Downfall</em> and after 5 albums and countless world tours, his rock band Fozzy has been named "a larger than life and wildly entertaining band," by Kerrang magazine. He splits his time between Los Angeles and Tampa, where he lives with his wife and three children. For more info go to fozzyrock.com or follow Chris on twitter @iamjericho.An entertaining follow-up to their popular book A Lion's Tale, international wresting superstar Jericho and co-writer Fornatale continue their chronicle of Jericho's wild ride through the wacky world of professional wrestling. This book picks up where the earlier book ended&#x2014;with Jericho in 1999 joining Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Enterprise, the most important venue in wresting&#x2014;and ends with Jericho's return to the ring in 2007 after a two-year retirement. Jericho hilariously details these key years as WWE's resident bad guy. His feuds with WWE's colorful (and colorfully profane) cast, including the likes of X-Pac, Ken Shamrock, Chyna, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, and Christian, are solidly recounted, although most of this will be old news to hardcore WWE fans. But the most interesting stories involve his battles on- and off-stage with such better-known stars as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Goldberg&#x2014;whom Jericho once had run over by a limousine during an episode of WWE's Raw series. It is here that Jericho shines and proves once again that, next to Mick Foley, he is an insightful and funny observer of pro wrestling's absurd universe. (Feb.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

As gallery goers soon discovered, this address did not exist&#x2015;the street numbers went from 16 to 20 to 24 to 28&#x2015;and neither did the art supposedly exhibited there. The ads were promoting fictional shows by fictional artists in a fictional gallery. The scheme, eventually exposed by a <i>New York Times</i> reporter, was concocted by the artist Terry Fugate-Wilcox as both work of art and critique of the art world. In this book, Christopher Howard brings this forgotten Conceptual art project back into view. &nbsp;&nbsp;Howard demonstrates that Fugate-Wilcox's project was an exceptionally clever embodiment of many important aspects of Conceptualism, incisively synthesizing the major aesthetic issues of its time&#x2015;documentation and dematerialization, serialism and process, text and image, publishing and publicity. He puts the Jean Freeman Gallery in the context of other magazine-based work by Mel Bochner, Judy Chicago, Yoko Ono, and Ed Ruscha, and compares the fictional artists' projects with actual Earthworks by Walter De Maria, Peter Hutchinson, Dennis Oppenheim, and more. Despite the deadpan perfection of the Jean Freeman Gallery project, the art establishment marginalized its creator, and the project itself was virtually erased from art history. Howard corrects these omissions, drawing on deep archival research, personal interviews, and investigation of fine-printed clues to shed new light on a New York art world mystery.</p><p>Christopher Howard is an art historian, critic, and editor based in New York.

This should not excite any personal feelings in any person normally or properly constituted; which unfortunately Marsh is not. He makes so many errors, and is so deficient that he will always be liable to excitement and tribulation. I suspect a Hospital will yet receive him.--Edward Drinker Cope, paleontologist (1840-1897)Fred, who lives down the street from me, has a cottage on Georgian Bay. One weekend he went up there alone and left his tabby cat back home with his wife and kids. The damned tabby ran in front of a car right outside my townhouse. Killed instantly.Fred loved that cat, and his wife knew he'd be upset when she told him what had happened. But when he got back Sunday evening, he said he already knew the cat was dead--because, according to the version of the story I eventually heard over my back fence, he'd seen his cat up at the cottage, two hundred kilometers away. The tabby had appeared to him one last time to say good-bye.I always looked at Fred a little differently after I'd heard that. I mean, it was fantastic, and fantastic things don't happen in normal lives. Certainly they don't happen to people like me.Or so I thought.I'm a paleontologist; a dinosaur guy. Some might think that's glamorous, I suppose, but it sure doesn't <i>pay</i> glamorously. Oh,about twice a year, I get my name in the paper or five seconds on <i>CBC Newsworld,</i> commenting on a new exhibition or some new find. But that's about it for excitement. Or at least it was, until I got involved in this project.<i>Time travel.</i>I feel like an idiot typing those two words. I'm afraid anyone who reads them will start looking at me the way I look at poor Fred.Sure, by now everyone has probably read about the mission in the papers, or seen the preparations on TV. Yeah, it really works. Ching-Mei Huang has demonstrated it enough times. And, yes, it's incredible, absolutely incredible, that she went from a first discovery of the underlying principle in 2005 to a working time machine by 2013. Don't ask me how she did it so fast; I don't have a clue. In fact, sometimes I don't think Ching-Mei has a clue, either.But it works.Or, at least, the first Throwback worked; the automated probe returned with air samples (a little more oxygen than today, no pollution, and, fortunately, no harmful germs), plus about four hours' worth of pictures, showing lots of foliage and, at one point, a turtle.But now we're going to try it with human beings; if this test works, a bigger mission, with everyone from meteorologists to entomologists, will be sent back next year.But for this attempt, only two people were going back, and one of them was me: Brandon Thackeray, forty-four, a little paunchy, a lot gray, a goddamned civil servant, a museum curator. Yes, I'm also a scientist. Got a Ph.D.--from an American university, to boot--and I suppose it makes sense that it would be a scientist who'd go gallivanting across time. But I'm not an adventurer. I'm just a regular guy, with quite enough to deal with, thank you very much, without something like this. An ailing father, a divorce, a mortgage that I <i>might</i> be able to payoff by the beginning of the next geologic era, hay fever. Regular stuff.But this was far from regular.We were hanging by a thread.Okay, it was really a steel cable, about three centimeters thick, but it didn't give me any more reassurance.And I wished that damned swaying would stop.Our time machine had been lifted up by a Sikorsky Sky Crane, and was now hanging a thousand meters above the stark beauty of the Badlands of Alberta. The pounding of the helicopter's engines thundered in my ears.I wished that noise would stop, too.But most of all, I wished Klicks would stop.Stop being an asshole, that is.He wasn't really doing anything. Just lying there in his crash couch, on the other side of the semicircular chamber. But he's so smug, so goddamned smug. The couch is like a high-tech La-Z-Boy upholstered in black vinyl and mounted on a swivel base. Your feet are lifted up, your spine tips at an angle, and a tubular headrest supports your noggin. Well, Klicks had his legs crossed at the ankle and his arms interlaced behind his head. He looked so bloody calm. I knew he was doing it just to bug me.I, on the other hand, was gripping the armrests of my crash couch like one of those poor souls who are afraid to fly.It was about two minutes until the Throwback.It should work.But it might not.In two minutes we could be dead.And he had his legs <i>crossed</i>."Klicks," I said.He looked over at me. We were almost exactly the same age, but opposites in a lot of ways. Not that it matters, but I'm white and he's black--he was born in Jamaica and came to Canada asa boy with his parents. (I always marveled that anyone would leave that climate for this one.) He's clean-shaven and hasn't started to gray yet. I've got a full beard, have lost about half my hair, and what's left is about evenly split between gray and brown. He's taller and broader-shouldered than me, plus, despite having a job that involves as much time at a desk as mine does, he's somehow avoided middle-age spread.But most of all, we're opposites in temperament. He's so cool, so laid-back, that even when he's standing he gives the impression of being stretched out somewhere, tropical drink in hand.Me, I think I'm getting ulcers.Anyway, he looked in my direction, his face a question. "Yeah?"I didn't know what I had intended to say. After a moment, I blurted out, "You really should put on your shoulder straps.""What for?" he replied in that too-smooth voice of his. "If the programmed stasis delay works, it won't matter if I'm standing on my head when they rev up the Huang Effect. And if it doesn't work ..." He shrugged. "Well, man, those straps will slice you like a hard-boiled egg."Typical. I sighed and pulled my straps tighter, the thick nylon bands reassuringly solid. I saw him smile, just a bit--but also just enough so that he could be sure that I would see the smile, the patronizing expression.A crackle of static from the radio speaker fought to be heard above the sounds of the helicopter, then: "Brandy, Miles, are you ready?" It was the precise voice of Ching-Mei Huang herself, measured, monotonal, clicking over the consonants like a series of circuit breakers."Ready and waiting," Klicks said, jaunty."Let's get it over with," I said."Brandy, are you okay?" asked Ching-Mei."I'm fine," I lied, wishing I had a bucket to throw up into. The swaying back and forth was getting to me. "Just do it, will you?""As you say," she replied. "Sixty seconds to Throwback. Good luck--and God protect." I was sure that little reference to God was for the sake of the network cameras. Ching-Mei was an atheist; she only had faith in empirical data, in experimental results.I took a deep breath and looked around the small room. <i>His Majesty's Canadian Timeship Charles Hazelius Sternberg</i>. Great name, eh? We'd had a list of about a dozen paleontologists we could have honored, but old Charlie won out because, in addition to his pioneering fossil hunting in Alberta, he'd actually written a science-fiction story about time travel, published in 1917: The PR people loved that.Ching-Mei's voice over the radio speakers: <i>"Fifty-five. Fifty-four</i>. <i>Fifty-three."</i>Anyway, nobody ever calls it <i>His Majesty's Canadian, Etc.</i> Instead, our timeship is almost universally known as the <i>Sternberger</i>, because to most people it looks like a fat hamburger. To me, though, it looks more like a squat version of the <i>Jupiter 2</i>, the spaceship from that ridiculous TV series <i>Lost in Space</i>. Just like the Space Family Robinson's vehicle, the <i>Sternberger</i> was essentially a two-level disk. We even had a little dome on the roof like they did. Ours housed meteorological and astronomical instruments; there was room enough for one person to squeeze into it.<i>"Forty-eight. Forty-seven. Forty-six."</i>The <i>Sternberger</i> was much smaller than the <i>Jupiter 2,</i> though--only five meters in diameter. Our lower deck wasn't designed for people; it was just 150 centimeters thick and consisted mostly of our water tank and part of the garage for our Jeep.<i>"Forty-one. Forty. Thirty-nine."</i>Our upper deck was divided into two halves, each semicircular in shape. One half contained the habitat. Along its curving outer wall was a kidney-shaped worktable, our radio console, and a compact laboratory unit crammed with geological andbiological instruments. The straight back wall, marking the ship's diameter line, had three doors built into it. Door number one--does anybody remember Monty Hall?--led to a little ladder that angled up into the rooftop instrumentation dome and to a ramp that went down the meter and a half to the outer entrance door. Door number two led to the Jeep's garage, which took up the height of both decks. Door number three gave access to the washroom stall.<i>"Thirty-four. Thirty-three. Thirty-two."</i>Mounted against the central wall in the gaps between the doorways were a small stand with an old microwave oven on it, a large food refrigerator, a bank of three equipment lockers swiped from some high school demolition sale, and a small medical refrigerator with a first-aid ki...</p><h2>Indian Children&#39;s Favorite Stories</h2><p><b>This colorfully illustrated multicultural children's book presents Indian fairy tales and other folk stories&#x2014;providing insight into a vibrant literary culture.</b> <br><br><i>Indian Children's Favorite Stories</i> is a charming selection of eight Indian tales that provide an insight into traditional Indian culture.

Narrated by Sal Paradise, one of Kerouac's alter-egos, <i>On the Road</i> is a cross-country bohemian odyssey that not only influenced writing in the years since its 1957 publication but penetrated into the deepest levels of American thought and culture.JACK KEROUAC was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1922. His first novel, <i>The Town and the City</i>, appeared in 1950, but it was <i>On the Road</i>, first published in 1957, that established his worldwide reputation as the chronicler of the Beat Generation.

A useful resource for personal study, small groups, Sunday school and new member classes, this study encourages the recovery of worship that is unashamedly God-centered and manifestly Scriptural. Rediscover the beauty of Reformed worship for the 21st Century. <p> Jon Payne deftly guides readers through the various parts of the worship service and explains not simply why these activities constitute Reformed worship. He also carefully delineates why Presbyterians worship the way they do. In so doing, Payne provides a clear, convincing and edifying account of historic Reformed worship. Here Christians will find great assistance for the most significant part of each week. </p><p><b> - Dr. Darryl G.

Dr. Payne is a graduate of Clemson University, Reformed Theological Seminary and the University of Edinburgh, New College. He has been serving as minister of Grace Presbyterian Church (PCA) in Douglasville, GA since June 2003.Jon Payne has given us a gem in his new book, <i> In the Splendor of Holiness <i>. Cutting through the forest of opinion on worship, Dr. Payne gets to the heart of the matter in a brief but succinct account of what constitutes the heart of corporate worship. Nothing is more important than the public worship of God, but our age has yielded to the gods of flippancy and utilitarian- ism. It seems all too obvious to ask, what has God commanded that we do when we gather together for public worship? The answer? Here it is in his book! I cannot recommend it too highly. It deserves to be in every Christian home. --<b>Dr. Derek Thomas, Professor of Systematic Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary, Jackson <b><br><br><i> In the Splendor of Holiness <i> is clear, well-reasoned, practical, and, above all things, thoroughly biblical. And it is as needed as it is helpful. I will consider this as essential reading for officer training classes, and it is suitable for distribution to prospective new member classes. Through Jon Payne's work we hear the voice of our Good Shepherd on a subject that has become part of the ruins of evangelicalism. Thankfully, with pastors like Dr. Payne, our Savior's church will be fed and led. This is a tool that every Reformed pastor should want his people to know and love. --<b> --Dr. David W.

In his study of Marx and the role of technology in the modern world, Kostas Axelos interprets Marx from his own distinctive, thought-provoking, philosophical position to achieve two purposes: to examine Marx&#39;s thinking as a coherent an comprehensive philosophy of the human world and then to show it as offering profound insight into the nature and role of technology in that world.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>A God in Ruins</h2><p><p>Master storyteller and international bestselling author of <em>Redemption, Trinity,</em> and <em>Exodus,</em> Leon Uris once again brilliantly interweaves historical fact with gripping fiction in this powerful novel of politics, family, intrigue, love, and the passions that rule human lives. </p><p>Spanning the decades from World War II to the 2008 presidential campaign, <em>A God in Ruins</em> is the unforgettable story of Quinn Patrick O'Connell, an honest, principled, and courageous man on the brink of becoming the second Irish Catholic President of the United States. In an era morally unmoored, rife with armed separatists and fundamentalist zealotry, Quinn, the last great liberal of the Rocky Mountains, emerges as America's hope to reclaim its great past and its promises of the future. But Quinn is a man with an explosive secret that can shatter his political ambitions and threaten his life--a secret buried for over a half century that even he does not know.... </p><p>Returning home at the end of World War II a decorated and wounded hero, Daniel Timothy O'Connell had moved his young wife, Siobhan, from the crowded streets of Brooklyn to the golden mountains of Colorado. Building a successful life as cattle ranchers, Daniel and Siobhan had everything they wanted--except a child. Desperate, they turned to the Church and adopted a beautiful three-year-old of mysterious parentage, a charming little boy they named Quinn Patrick. </p><p>In riveting prose, Leon Uris unfolds Quinn's life as he matures from a restless youth into a brave Marine undertaking a deadly undercover mission, and finally, into an earnest, intelligent, and thoughtful leader willing take on the most vicious and malevolently destructive forces threatening the country. Here, too, are the two beautiful women who have always loved him--Greer, the lover driven by ambition and passion, and Rita, the sensuous, adoring daughter of his friend and mentor, painter and philosopher Reynaldo Maldonado.</p><p>Through the years Quinn has made some powerful enemies who are determined to destroy him, including presidential incumbent Thornton Tomtree. A conservative computer mogul who built an electronic empire out of his father's Rhode Island junkyard, Tomtree is a right-wing pragmatist who will court the most dangerous and deadly elements of society and risk America s safety to achieve his own ambitions. </p><p>From America's victorious past to its shadowed future, from the grandeur of Colorado's mountains to the enclaves of private militias hidden deep in the canyons of the Southwest's Four Corners, <em>A God in Ruins</em> races to a powerful, unforgettable conclusion. A sweeping novel of a man, a life, and a nation, it vividly brings to life memorable characters that will indelibly touch the heart and mind and illuminates the major crisis facing America at the dawn of a new millennium. </p></p><p>Veteran bestselling author Leon Uris (<i>Exodus</i>, <i>Trinity</i>) stays true to form with <i>A God in Ruins</i>, delivering yet another vast and vigorous novel about politics and history, right and wrong, love and loss. This time his country of choice is the United States, on the eve of the 2008 presidential election. <p> The incumbent, Thornton Tomtree, is running against the Catholic governor of Colorado, Quinn Patrick O'Connell. Thornton, who grew up playing in his daddy's Providence junkyard, made billions on a computer invention before becoming president. Brainy, calculating, and stiff, he lacks both charm and scruples--qualities that the honest and open Quinn, an ex-Marine, has in spades. Though set in 2008, <i>A God in Ruins</i> has its roots firmly in the past. In order to flesh out his characters, Uris casts his net all the way back to World War II, highlighting some of the more dramatic moments in Thornton and Quinn's lives as they move inexorably from youth towards a run for the White House. In the process, Uris takes up some of the attention-grabbing political issues in America from the second half of the 20th century: gun control, terrorist attacks, and Clinton's sex scandals. </p><p> Uris can always be counted on to inject the political with the personal, and Quinn is the perfect vehicle for this when his presidential bid is threatened at the eleventh hour by potentially damning information about his past. A lively supporting cast of characters--from Quinn's delicious wife Rita to Thornton's conflicted right-hand man Darnell--adds spark to this emotional story. At one point, when the campaign has reached a fever pitch, Thornton says about Quinn, "Our jingle-jangle rope-a-dope cowboy is going to be a handful." So is Uris's engaging book, which positively spills over with simple heroism and hot-button political issues. <i>--Katherine Anderson</i></p><p>Internationally acclaimed novelist Leon Uris ran away from home at age seventeen, a month after the attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the Marine Corps, and he served at Guadalcanal and Tarawa. His first novel, <em>Battle Cry</em>, was based on his own experiences in the Marines, which he revisited in his final novel, <em>O'Hara's Choice</em>. His other novels include the bestsellers <em>Redemption, Trinity, Exodus, QB VII,</em> and <em>Topaz,</em> among others. Leon Uris passed away in June 2003.</p></p><h2>MISS READ FARTHER AFIELD</h2><p>This book is new.</p><p></p><h2>Venice and Food</h2><p>'This is an almost indescribably ethereal work of love that portrays Venice and its food as no other book has ever done.

Brenda lives in Port Hope, Ontario.</p>PreS --A Disneyesque turtle, rabbit, fox, and otter illustrate this trite story of a turtle who is always late, and who is distracted by his friends while on the way to the home of his friend Bear. The language is unimaginative, the story thin, and the ending predictable--Franklin is on his way to a birthday party for Bear. Woodland yellows and greens predominate, and the background settings are far more pleasing than the animals in the foreground, all of whom lack character or personality. A slow moving tale, distinguished neither by plot nor illustration. --Trev Jones, School Library Journal<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Poor Mouth (Picador Books)</h2><p>1979 Picador trade paperback vg++ to fine book In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>The Poor Mouth relates the story of one Bonaparte O&#39;Coonassa, born in a cabin in a fictitious village called Corkadoragha in western Ireland equally renowned for its beauty and the abject poverty of its residents. Potatoes constitute the basis of his family&#39;s daily fare, and they share both bed and board with the sheep and pigs. A scathing satire on the Irish, this work brought down on the author&#39;s head the full wrath of those who saw themselves as the custodians of Irish language and tradition when it was first published in Gaelic in 1941.Flann O'Brien, whose real name was Brian O'Nolan, also wrote under the pen name of Myles na Gopaleen. He was born in 1911 in County Tyrone. A resident of Dublin, he graduated from University College after a brilliant career as a student (editing a magazine called Blather) and joined the Civil Service, in which he eventually attained a senior position.

These were Isaac Jogues' words on the eve of embarking for a second missionary attempt in America. Shortly afterward, a skull-splitting Mohawk tomahawk made him a martyr.<p>Fresh from the elegant life of Renaissance France, Jesuit priest Isaac Jogues landed in the savage wilderness of America in 1636. He came fervent in his priestly zeal to devote his life to Christianizing and civilizing the Indian nations that stalked the trackless forests -- savages he was prepared to love, sight unseen, for the love of God. He lived among the Hurons enduring hunger, thirst, disease, and humiliation at their hands.</p><p>A vast canvas unrolls in this suspenseful and swift-moving story of heroic sacrifice in the earliest days of New York and Canada. Against a background of bloody wars between great Indian nations and between the savages and the first European settlers in America passes the magnificent figure of the Jesuit, Isaac Jogues, intrepid pioneer, adventurer, victim of horrific cruelties, and saint. This is a story of violent action and great sacrifice that testifies to the faith and heroism of Isaac Jogues and his fellow martyrs.</p></p><p></p><h2>Goldwyn: A Biography</h2><p><b>Samuel Goldwyn</b> was the premier dream-maker of his era, and in this lavishly-praised biography, the&nbsp;Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award-winning author of <b>Lindbergh</b> and <b>Max Perkins: Editor of Genius</b> offers a life story as rich with drama as anything found on the silver screen...</p><p><b>A.

This comprehensive, amusing account of his private life and lengthy career as a Hollywood studio head--by the author of Max Perkins: Editor of Genius --depicts an often unscrupulous businessman, gambler, woman-chaser and inadequate father, who frequently burst into tears when overcome by emotion or frustration and who was married for more than 40 years to a charming, witty, tough-as-nails social lioness. The book is peppered with hundreds of Goldwyn's famous and infamous malapropisms, dozens of anecdotes about his critical and commercial failures as well as his outstanding successes ( Wuthering Heights ; The Little Foxes ; The Best Years of Our Lives ), and details of his relationships with, among scores of others, Eddie Cantor, Ronald Colman, Merle Oberon, Gary Cooper, George Cukor, William Wyler, Billy Wilder.

H.L.S. 2004 Audie Award Finalist � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Cold Snap: Stories</h2><p>Ten stories provide jolting excursions through a world of desperation and fleeting transcendence, with protagonists ranging from a hard-luck fighter, to a drunken doctor in a remote African aid-station, to a strung-out advertising writer. Reprint.</p><p>Thom Jones may be one of the few authors whose acknowledgments thank not only his dog, wife, and agent, but also Wyeth/Ayerst Laboratories and Stuart Pharmaceuticals, manufacturers of Effexor and Elavil--"drugs so good they feel illegal." Likewise, <i>Cold Snap</i>, Jones's second volume of short fiction, is so good these stories feel (but thankfully are not) illegal. In typically manic style they draw tragicomic portraits of boxers, Marines, and other assorted tough-guy types--even, in "Rocketfire Red," a part-Aborigine surfer girl turned drag racer and international model. Pitchman extraordinaire Ad Magic from <i>The Pugilist at Rest</i> returns, writing fraudulent but devastatingly effective direct-mail appeals for Global Aid even as he loses his mind on the combined effects of Dexedrine, paregoric, malaria, and a thumb smashed by Rwandan soldiers. In "Way Down Deep in the Jungle," another Africa story, cynical Dr. Koestler's baboon absconds with an entire bottle of whiskey, then entertains the natives with shockingly accurate imitations of the American smoking, masturbating, and moving his bowels. A plastic surgeon boxes his way through a fatal heart attack in "Ooh Baby Baby"; a diabetic with an amputated foot feeds a black widow spider in "Pickpocket"; the young Marine of "Pot Shack" compounds his foolishness in joining up ("<i>Why</i> did you join? Why <i>did</i> you join? Etc. <i>Why did you fucking join</i>?") by volunteering for recon, "where they take awful to a new level." It's the kind of fictional universe in which a manic doctor plays Russian roulette to cheer himself up, and the result is somehow, improbably, funny. But these stories go well beyond whistling in the dark. They are in fact a way to hold our 20th-century demons at bay, as the epigraph from 1 Samuel suggests: "Seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre: and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well." May we all be well, and may Thom Jones play on. <i>--Mary Park</i>Offering 10 stories reprinted from magazines like the New Yorker and Playboy, Jones's second collection of short fiction displays the gritty, fatalistic vision and narrative adrenaline that distinguished his NBA-nominated The Pugilist at Rest. Set in Africa, the West Coast and other locales, these tales are teeming slices of life, full of unexpected pathos and black humor amid imagery of warfare, starvation, disease and decay. Jones's most vivid heroes?star-crossed doctors and loners, battling manic episodes and self-destructive behavior?decamp to Africa to escape dismal lives at home or return home from Africa in antisocial states. In the title story, a manic depressive doctor, stripped of his license, just back from a stint in Nairobi with Global Aid, spends two days with his lobotomized younger sister?visiting the zoo, watching TV and chatting with Jehovah's Witnesses. In "Superman, My Son," a supermarket magnate, beleaguered by debt, pays a visit to his son?a larger-than-life, born-again manic depressive with a superman complex. "Quicksand" chronicles the unlikely dalliance between a gonzo copywriter for Global Aid, who suffers from malaria and a broken thumb, and a gorgeous Danish doctor travelling from Rwanda to Zaire. The hardwon epiphanies of these embattled individuals make horrifyingly clear the legacy of warfare in the developing world and the everyday tragedies of contemporary America. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sky Dance - Super Edition (Dinotopia(R))</h2><p>Since he was small, Marc has wanted to be a tightrope walker - even though he has no sense of balance and a fear of heights.

Original.</p><p></p><h2>The Selected Letters of Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, 1956-1991</h2><p>One of the central relationships in the Beat scene was the long-lasting friendship of Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder. Ginsberg introduced Snyder to the East Coast Beat writers, including Jack Kerouac, while Snyder himself became the model for the serious poet that Ginsberg so wanted to become. Snyder encouraged Ginsberg to explore the beauty of the West Coast and, even more lastingly, introduced Ginsberg to Buddhism, the subject of so many long letter exchanges between them. Beginning in 1956 and continuing through 1991, the two men exchanged more than 850 letters. Bill Morgan, Ginsberg&#x2019;s biographer and an important editor of his papers, has selected the most significant correspondence from this long friendship. The letters themselves paint the biographical and poetic portraits of two of America&#x2019;s most important&#x2014;and most fascinating&#x2014;poets.</p><p>Starred Review. This sparkling collection of letters between Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg offers enthusiasts an intimate glimpse of the poets' shared vision of creativity, spiritualism, and their work, as well as literary and sexual adventures from across the globe. In vivid prose that makes the infamous Yage Letters (between Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs) seem juvenile, these legendary Americans reveal a stunning amount, sharing both innermost doubts and grand career aspirations. Ginsberg's voice often feels more authentic, with a natural story-teller's zeal for conveying the racy details of his personal life; he also exposes the paranoia and crushing self-doubt that forever plagued him. Snyder, while earthy and open, often veers towards metaphysical subjects and writes more cautiously, as if aware of his legacy even in these pre-fame days. Though it's a small miracle so many letters survived the writers' extensive travel, gaps in the chronology may frustrate some readers. Still, the decades-spanning dialogue never fails to entertain or offer deeper insight into the artists' process. ("No wire or pill will ever put a poet out of work," Snyder insists.) Filled with the sort of high-minded yearning for knowledge that Ginsberg and Snyder are known for, this volume presents a thrilling opportunity to eavesdrop on two of the most intriguing American poets-and personalities-of the 20th Century. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its eerie tinkling peels away the years like a bride&#x2019;s clothing, inviting the memory of my first night as Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x2019;s wife. As soon as the image enters my mind, it drifts away&#x2014;delicate, elusive, and almost impossible to grasp, like a butterfly on the banks of Walden Pond. I open the oak door and enter the room, but only silence waits. The music box rests undisturbed on a table beneath a layer of dust.<br><br> &#x201c;Naughty ghost,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Do not make mischief today, of all days.&#x201d;<br><br> I walk to the window and look down toward the pine path, the well-worn trail between our home and the Alcotts&#x2019;. There in the dark tangle of evergreens, where breezes whisper down the hill, a retreat of a half hour&#x2019;s time renews my brooding husband. I have patted the pines&#x2019; sturdy trunks, thanking them for giving Nathaniel these moments of peace, and have sensed their replies in the fragrant sighing of their branches. He soon emerges, stooped and white haired. Even years after his swift aging during our difficulties in Italy, it is still jarring to see Nathaniel so altered in appearance. In my mind and heart he is ever my young summer husband.<br><br> In spite of my wish to meet him when he comes into the house, a presence in this room seems to insist that I remain here. Could it be one of the women Nathaniel&#x2019;s ancestors judged for a witch and condemned to hang, or one of our deceased friends or relations? The remembrance of our dead loved ones paralyzes me so that I do not step into the hallway even when I hear Nathaniel&#x2019;s footfall reach the landing and then climb the narrow stairs to the sky parlor. As we both approach six decades of life, he often tells me that I am his earthly savior&#x2014;a gift from God to bring light to him, who is so apt to see dark. He has fought the coil and stain of the black weeds of his forefathers, even changing the spelling of his surname, to ascend from the bones they left scattered about Salem graveyards. He is still climbing, trying to rise above them.<br><br> Nathaniel&#x2019;s need for elevation inspired the tower he had erected on the third floor of our home, the Wayside, in Concord, Massachusetts, fashioned after the mossy castle lookout where we once summered in Florence. The Wayside is the only home we have ever owned. It is the place where we finally unpacked all the trunks, where the wall colors have faded around portraits, where the dear rooms have embraced our family. The Wayside creaks and heaves sighs like an old, fat grandmama who has sat vigil for so many years that she has coughed the dust of British soldiers&#x2019; boots marching to the commencing battles of the Revolutionary War, has harbored frightened runaway Negroes on their North Star quests, and now hosts this stubborn ghost who enjoys giving us a fright.<br><br> I know the secrets in her, this house. There is a floorboard in this room that can be lifted, where a mahogany letterbox holds the papers Nathaniel insisted I cut out and burn from our journals and epistles. I imagine how they must quiver, eager to escape and breathe. Once Nathaniel has left on his journey, perhaps I will go through the artifacts. I should look forward to this airing of my spirit, like pinning clean laundry to the line, but I have a place Nathaniel has inserted into me like a grafting on a tree that says these things should stay private.<br><br> The floorboards creak above my head in the sad cadence of the man who haunts his writing space. The room is ten by ten feet, and a trapdoor allows him entrance and solitude, but the tower where he wanted to escape from civilization sticks like a belfry above our house, the tin roof giving no insulation from heat or cold, the windows illuminating his dark silhouette for every neighbor and traveler to see by the light of the astral lamp. The sky parlor was to be his respite, but like all places where Nathaniel thinks he will finally find peace and home, it has disappointed him.<br><br> Knowing that Nathaniel will remain upstairs until our carriage to Boston comes, and that our children are away or occupied, I cannot resist the letterbox. I count four planks from the window and reach my finger into the small knot in the wood to pry it loose. A musty smell emerges on a puff of old dust, making me sneeze. I wait to be sure my husband does not come in and worry over my health, which has plagued us so often these years.<br><br> When I am convinced he still walks in the tower, I lift the box with the courtship letters, the marriage journal, the sketches, and pressed flowers brought back from the places we traveled. A dried paintbrush holds the residue of a long-ago color&#x2014;the emerald green of an Italian forest on a canvas I painted for Nathaniel, which he used to hide behind a black veil. The flowers are faded like old tapestries hung too long in the sun, and include a night-blooming cereus from my maiden days in Cuba, a white pond lily from the Concord River, and a red poppy from Florence. Under the flowers is a sketch I drew in the days of fevered, falling-in-love inspiration, of a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis. One wing is unfurled, welcoming the breath of spring zephyrs into its body. The other is curled and wet, waiting to escape its confinement.<br><br> The chime of the parlor&#x2019;s clock reminds me that we have but an hour before the carriage arrives. I have packed Nathaniel&#x2019;s belongings, so I may spend time with these artifacts from our past that are calling to me, urging me to look for something that I do not know is missing. I hold on to a small hope that this springtime journey to New Hampshire that Nathaniel will make with his dearest friend, former president Franklin Pierce, might restore my husband&#x2019;s vitality. I will escort him to Boston by carriage, where he and Franklin will then catch a train north, making stops along the way. I pray that if Nathaniel uses this excursion to reflect on how far he has come, how unlike his ancestors he is, and what a rich and fascinating life of experience he has given us, perhaps he will no longer despair.<br><br> A dark eye peers out from under the butterfly sketch, giving me a strange thrill. I drew the son of a plantation owner before I met Nathaniel. It was during the year and a half I spent in Cuba, in my maiden days, when I discovered my capacity for love. In spite of that time of passion and growth, I was injured in my soul from Cuba, and I wonder whether it would have been better if I had never gone. I run my finger over the portrait&#x2019;s lips, imagining what the planter&#x2019;s life has been since I left him thirty years ago. My senses are aroused, and I can nearly smell the robust fragrance of Cuban coffee, feel the waxy tropical foliage, hear the melancholy melody brought forth from the planter&#x2019;s long, dark fingers on the piano keys.<br><br> Nathaniel&#x2019;s cough startles me. I am aware that another man&#x2019;s likeness is under my hand while my husband stands across the room. Ridiculous though it is, I feel as guilty as if I were caught with a lover. I turn the paper facedown in the letterbox, hoping Nathaniel will not ask about its contents, arrange my face into a smile, and say, &#x201c;Are you nearly ready, my love?&#x201d;<br><br> He is mid grimace from the pain in his stomach, but upon my address, Nathaniel&#x2019;s shoulders relax and his lips form a smile. I leave my memories and cross the room to him, wrapping my arms around him. Nathaniel&#x2019;s coat is damp with sweat, and the heat coming from him frightens me.<br><br> &#x201c;You are feverish,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;You must go to bed. Stay with me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I would like nothing better, my dove,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;But this is a journey I must make.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then let me come with you,&#x201d; I say, knowing such a wish is impossible. I have asked no one to care for the children, and we haven&#x2019;t the money for both of us to travel at this time.<br><br> &#x201c;You must stay and keep our children well, and our hearths glowing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For your return,&#x201d; I say.<br><br> He does not answer, but brushes a lock of gray hair from my forehead.<br><br> &#x201c;See that you come back to me,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I cannot bear this earth long without my companion.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nor I,&#x201d; he says.<br><br> I kiss Nathaniel, and when he pulls away his gaze falls on the box and rests there. I hold my breath, wondering whether he will ask about it, but he grimaces again, his pain appearing to distract him from any questions. He leaves to descend to the first floor and wait for the carriage, and I take one last look at the papers before putting them back into hiding, but the artifacts seem to shiver, to urge, and I am unable to part from them.<br><br><i> What do you want of me?</i> I think. <i>Am I to draw again? To paint? Is it even possible to resurrect the artist in me, whom I have neglected these many years?</i><br><br> Light coming in through the window falls on the Cuba Journal. I turn its pages, and imagine Nathaniel reading it in solitude as a young man, coming to know me safely in print before courting me in the flesh. I wonder which of my words kindled his heart&#x2019;s fire and his writer&#x2019;s pen. Was it my acceptance of the possibility of love, or the vivid portraiture of my words that inspired his? Did Nathaniel sense that a woman so open to newness in the society of others could serve as an interpreter of the world for him?<br><br> I begin reading and soon lose track of time. It as if the decades dissolve and I am back in that exotic land, immersed in the words of my own hand, in worlds crafted from my writings, that conjure a full palette of scenery, society, passion, and tragedy.<br><br> My wordsmith is wary of words, and finds them inadequate because they fail him, but I am more trusting. Burrowed in my journal is the story that wants me to remember that traveling to Cuba allowed me to emerge from my maidenhood to become the woman&#x2014;the artist&#x2014;who would wed Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p><h2>Harcourt Social Studies: Homework and Practice Book Student Edition Grade 6 US: Civil War to Present</h2><p>Product Name: Harcourt Social Studies: Homework and Practice Book Student Edition Grade 6 US: Civil War to Present</p><p></p><h2>The MacGregors: Alan &amp; Grant: All The PossibilitiesOne Man's Art</h2><p>The MacGregors: Alan Grant by Nora Roberts released on Feb 28, 2006 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Setting: Contemporary U.S.<br> Sensuality Rating: 8<p> Bestselling author Nora Roberts continues her acclaimed MacGregor series with two romantic novellas in <i>The MacGregors: Alan and Grant</i>. In <i>All the Possibilities</i>, Washington, D.C., socialite Shelby Campbell meets Senator Alan MacGregor and the attraction is immediate and powerful. Unfortunately, Shelby is determined to avoid romantic involvement with any public figure, a resolve that stems from her witnessing her politician father's assassination. A man in the spotlight, especially a man in politics, is too vulnerable, and she can't risk losing someone she loves again. Her determination is no match for Alan's, though, as the handsome MacGregor lays siege to the Campbell heart with weapons too compelling to resist.</p><p> In <i>One Man's Art</i>, Shelby's brother, Grant Campbell, has found his own way of coping with his loss. A famous cartoonist and political satirist, Grant lives as a virtual hermit in an isolated Maine lighthouse, jealously guarding his privacy. His battlements are breached, however, when beautiful Genvieve Grandeau arrives sodden and stranded on his doorstep. Genvieve, herself a renowned artist, has come to Maine seeking solitude and inspiration. When Grant's grudging willingness to assist a damsel in distress turns to outright surliness as he camouflages his attraction to her, she sets upon a mission to make him regret his rudeness. Soon she has more on her hands than she expected, as she and Grant both recognize a passion that neither can deny.</p><p> Though thinner in plot than the typical Roberts book--due to the shorter, double-novella format--<i>The MacGregors: Alan and Grant</i> nonetheless contains the same compelling characters, rich description, and sensuous storytelling known and loved by Roberts fans.

Three fresh inches of snow had fallen overnight. The capital had a majestic winter wonderland feel to it when it snowed. It tended to be the kind of wet, heavy snow that coated every branch, statue, and park bench. The city looked frozen in time, and in a sense it was. A lame-duck president occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and the president &#x2013; elect was one week away from taking his oath of office. Traditionally, the only business that got done the week before the inauguration was the business of pardons. Lawyers, lobbyists, and big-money players lined up to ask the president to forgive someone for a crime they had committed, or been accused of committing. Politics had gotten so rough that sometimes just being a friend of the president could bring about the unwanted attention of a special prosecutor. With that attention also came a mountain of legal bills. It was quickly becoming a tradition for outgoing presidents to wave a magic wand and make these legal problems go away. Pardons could also be about bricks and mortar. A new presidential library needed to be built, and they were not cheap. With this president, however, it was mostly about setting things right. </p><p>This should have been on Kennedy&#x2019;s mind, but it wasn&#x2019;t. As director of the Central Intelligence Agency she should have been lobbying for a blanket pardon herself, but her mind was occupied with the here and now. This transition period between presidential administrations was always stressful, but even more so this time. The nation was without decisive and focused leadership until the new administration took over, and that left them vulnerable. To make matters worse, the word was out that the new administration was going to clean house. This was no surprise to Kennedy. She knew the minute the election results came in that she was out of a job. Actually, she knew several weeks earlier when the CIA&#x2019;s Global Ops Center called to alert her of the attack on that Saturday in late October. </p><p>The motorcade of presidential candidate Josh Alexander had been hit by a car bomb. Alexander and his running mate had narrowly escaped. Their limousine had been flipped by the blast of the bomb, but the structural integrity of the outer shell held. Alexander walked away unharmed while his running mate, Mark Ross, suffered a separated shoulder and a cut above his left eye. The second limousine did not fare as well. The front third of the vehicle collapsed under the blast and exposed Alexander&#x2019;s wife and three Secret Service agents to the superheated gases of the explosion. All four people were virtually incinerated. Fifteen other individuals were also killed, and another thirty-four were wounded, seven of them critically. </p><p>An al-Qaeda splinter group had released a statement the week before the attack that they were going to disrupt the American elections. In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, Kennedy had a pretty good idea how the American people would react to such foreign intervention in the democratic process. Two weeks later they proved her right. They turned out in record numbers on election day, and Josh Alexander and Mark Ross were swept into office by a landslide. Shortly after the election Ross began making statements to the press that he was going to do a top-down review of the CIA. That was code for cleaning house. </p><p>Despite twenty-three years of service, Kennedy took none of this personally. It simply wasn&#x2019;t worth it. The people had spoken, and in one week there would be the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to another. Her chief focus for this last week would be to purge every possible piece of information that could come back and bite her, or any of her people, in the ass. Part of her unpleasant history with Ross was that he was a vindictive prick. Simply running her out of the job after two brief years as the first female director of the Agency might not be enough for him. Kennedy felt there was a real chance he would want to burn her at the stake, tie her up in investigations for the next decade. She made a mental note to ask President Hayes for that blanket pardon. After all she&#x2019;d done it would not be out of line to do so. </p><p>Kennedy took her eyes off the frozen landscape and checked her watch. They were late. <i>It must be the snow,</i> she thought to herself. It was a Saturday morning, and Kennedy worked most Saturday mornings. At least for another week. For all she knew, they&#x2019;d take away her pass and cardkey when she showed up for work a week from Monday. That would be Ross&#x2019;s style. He&#x2019;d make it as painful and embarrassing as possible. </p><p>There was an upside to all of this. At least, that was what she kept telling herself. At forty-five, she&#x2019;d given twenty-three years of her life to the CIA. She had a beautiful ten-year-old son whom she didn&#x2019;t get to spend enough time with. Soon he would enter that stage where he would want nothing to do with her. This premature departure from the Agency would give her a chance to spend more time with him. It was no secret in Washington that she was on her way out. She&#x2019;d already received two offers from local universities to teach, three from think tanks, and another from a private security firm. That was without lifting a finger. She tried to stay positive. Tried to tell herself they were great options, but in the end nothing else would match the mission and the people she worked with. That was what bothered her most. </p><p>There was a knock on the door and then it opened. Kennedy smiled when she saw it was Skip McMahon. </p><p>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201d; said the hulking six-foot-four FBI special agent. &#x201c;People in this town lose their minds when it snows.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good thing it&#x2019;s a Saturday.&#x201d; </p><p>McMahon was holding a large briefcase. He crossed the room and kissed Kennedy on the cheek. </p><p>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s this all about? Have you finally decided to announce your intention to marry me and make me an honest man?&#x201d; </p><p>Kennedy smiled and gestured toward the sitting area. &#x201c;Coffee or tea?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Since when do I drink tea?&#x201d; </p><p>She poured him a cup of coffee while McMahon sat on the couch.

The walls were covered with photos of people and places. Some of the photos were self-explanatory: former CIA directors, the Twin Towers, the Berlin Wall. Others were more obscure: a baby&#x2019;s hand wrapped around a father&#x2019;s finger, a demolished building with a man standing in the foreground sobbing, and a group of Arab women covered in black from head to toe walking down a dusty street. McMahon had been to the office many times. A naturally inquisitive person, he had asked Kennedy about some of the photos before. Her response was always the same. She simply smiled and changed the subject. It occured to him that this might be his last chance to glean the importance of the more cryptic shots. </p><p>&#x201c;The photo of the Arab women in black. Is that Saudi Arabia?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No. Yemen.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why do you have it in a frame?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a reminder of the subjugation of women in the Arab culture.&#x201d; </p><p>McMahon nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought.&#x201d; </p><p>Kennedy began laughing. </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; asked McMahon. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a reminder of the subjugation of Arab women. It&#x2019;s actually a team of Delta Force commandos who were on their way to say hello to an individual who, let&#x2019;s just say, wasn&#x2019;t playing by the rules.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re shitting me?&#x201d; McMahon stood up so he could examine the photo more closely. &#x201c;Who were they going after?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s classified.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Did they get him?&#x201d; </p><p>Kennedy nodded. </p><p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; McMahon settled back into his spot on the couch. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the deal with the meeting this morning?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Do you know Cap Baker?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The Republican strategist.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the mystery person you dragged me out here to see?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He assured me it was in your best interest.&#x201d; </p><p>A scowl of irritation fell across McMahon&#x2019;s leathered face. &#x201c;Why in the hell would I want to spend two minutes with a political whore, especially a Republican one?&#x201d; </p><p>Kennedy looked at her watch and ignored the question. </p><p>&#x201c;Why the hell didn&#x2019;t he just come see me at the Hoover Building?&#x201d; </p><p>Before Kennedy could answer, there was a knock on the door. A second later it opened and Cap Baker entered. If it weren&#x2019;t for his signature shock of gray hair they might not have recognized him. They were used to seeing him on TV wearing suits, expensive shirts, and fancy ties. He was rumored to charge eight hundred dollars an hour for his advice and lobbying skills.

That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m delighted to see the release of Crossway&#x2019;s <em>Christian Guides to the Classics</em>.

These guides offer exactly the kind of resources needed to empower high school and college students (whether in public, private, classical-Christian, or home schools) to connect with the Great Books and to ask the kinds of questions that we all must ask if we are to understand our full status as creatures made in the image of God who have fallen but who can be redeemed.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Louis Markos</strong><strong>,</strong> Professor of English and Scholar in Residence, Houston Baptist University; author, <em>From Achilles to Christ </em>and<em> Literature: A Student&#x2019;s Guide</em></p><p>&#x201c;It is hard to imagine a better guide than Leland Ryken to help readers navigate the classics.

It's only months before their wedding and they are eager to begin their new life together. The cottage is in need of renovation so Evan wastes no time before he begins making much-needed repairs.<br><br>But it turns out that Evan's discovery extends far beyond the beauties of a mountain-top view and a cozy dream-house when Evan finds the skeleton of a child buried in the front yard. His professional inclinations soon get the best of him and he cannot rest until he discovers the identity of the child.<br><br>The skeleton is decades old, but the discovery eerily coincides with the case of a present-day missing girl. Although discouraged by his fellow detectives, Evan dives into the mystery of both missing children. He soon realizes that if he can solve the decades-old death, he just might find a crucial insight into the whereabouts of the child missing in the present day. <br><br>Rhys Bowen's newest spell-binding addition to her critically acclaimed cozy series will win the hearts of fans and newcomers alike.&nbsp;<i>Evan's Gate</i> is a 2005 Edgar Award Nominee for Best Novel.<br></p><p>Rhys Bowen won the Agatha Award for best novel of the year and the Herodotus Award for best historical mystery of the year for <i>Murphy's Law</i>, her first installment in a new series featuring Molly Murphy and set in turn-of-the-century New York City.

When five-year-old Ashley Sholokhov goes missing during a seaside excursion, suspicion points to her Russian father, who's estranged from her mother. Meanwhile, to celebrate the 80th birthday of curmudgeonly gentleman sheep farmer Tomos Thomas, his middle-aged progeny return to the grassy, boulder-strewn hills of Llanfair, carrying blame, survivor's guilt and unanswered questions concerning the long-ago disappearance of Sarah, Tomos's granddaughter. The parallels between Sarah and Ashley weigh heavily upon Evan, who's eager to live up to his recent promotion to the Plainclothes Division. In desperation, Evan sticks his neck out a bit too far in this gorgeous and unruly terrain, where a hike in the hills can become treacherous when the sun goes down. Fortunately, his charming schoolmarm betrothed, Bronwen, is there to provide solace. Bowen delivers an enchanting portrait of Wales with genuine, flawed characters, a modicum of humor and plenty of red herrings to keep the detective constable and the reader guessing. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Spectacular also aptly describes the houses featured here. Some are renovations, others are new, futuristic constructions that incorporate traditional Southwestern styles. They are distinguished by Indian, Mexican and Spanish touches, from handwoven rugs to straw-inlay crosses, yet can comfortably accommodate art deco or classic French decor.

Wells is a surprising choice for narrating this book. His voice is urban and sophisticated, with no hint of soft edges that might be more suitable for a novel set in a simpler time in the American West. Fortunately, Wells deftly handles the life lessons discovered by 9-year-old Ken. Through Wells's voice we sense the vast gap between Ken's gentle mother and his demanding father, and what each parent brings to the son.

He graduated from the University of Oregon and later studied at Stanford with Wallace Stegner, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Scowcroft, and Frank O' Connor. <b>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</b>, his first novel, was published in 1962. His second novel, <b>Sometimes a Great Notion</b>, followed in 1964. His other books include <b>Kesey's Garage Sale</b>, <b>Demon Box</b>, <b>Caverns</b> (with O. U. Levon), <b>The Further Inquiry</b>, <b>Sailor Song</b>, and <b>Last Go Round</b> (with Ken Babbs). His two children's books are <b>Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear</b> and <b>The Sea Lion</b>. Ken Kesey died on November 10, 2001.</p> <br> <b>Barry Moser</b>, considered one of today's greatest designer/illustrators, is an engraver, painter, author, and lecturer on the art of the book. He has won many major awards for his illustrated children's books and letterpress editions of literary classics, which can be seen at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the National Gallery of Art.Little Tricker must think quickly when the double-hungry bear "comestet kabooming through the Bottom like a freight druvstet by the Devil himself, or at least his next hottest hollerer"--and indeed he does, concocting a scheme that not only outwits the bear but forever puts an end to his rampages. This tall tale from the Ozarks serves as a fine vehicle for Kesey ( One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest ; Sometimes a Great Notion ), proving ample enough for his quirky vision and his freewheeling use of language--his dialogue crackles, his forceful images and metaphors tumble one after another in an inexorable rush. Moser's watercolors capture the strange, strong flavor of the tale and provide emphatic, snapshot-like portraits of its characters. His view of Big Double, for example--dressed in jeans, T-shirt and wool cap; potbellied, with a twig drooping cigarette-like from his mouth; and leaning belligerently on a post--leaves no doubt that the bear is, as Tricker shrewdly calculates, a simple rough-hewn bully with far more brawn than brains.

After U.S. Army occupation duty from 1946 to 1950 in Italy, Germany, and Austria, and the U.N. vote to defend South Korea, he was reassigned to Fort Devens, Mass., to train recruits in weaponry. Shortly after arriving in Taegu, South Korea, their battalion was subjected to North Korean attacks. He recalls both fear and acts of bravery amid the deafening explosions, flying shrapnel, mortar and artillery fire, mass slaughter, bodies lying in piles, and the stunned reaction after a message dropped from a plane: "We were on our own. No relief column was on its way... and if we stayed in this hellhole we would all die." The final third of the book details his torture and starvation during 34 months as a POW, concluding with a short summary of his later military career. Aided by journalist Maurer, Richardson never pulls his punches in these vivid descriptions of bloody combat action, interrupted by occasional flashbacks to his youth on the streets of Philadelphia Photos, maps.

Staring up through the leaves, she measured their pace as they marched from tower to tower, noted how long and at which locations they tarried. She gave special attention to the changing of the guard, and was relieved that the same guards had been posted as on the other nights she&#x2019;d hidden here. Most important, though, was their mood. She weighed it&#x2014; as well as she could from a hundred feet below&#x2014; and to her great relief, found them attentive, but no more than usual. Had they seemed more prepared, on edge in some way, she knew she would have been forced to abandon her plan to kill the King of Kings. <br> &nbsp;<br> This great palace that sat atop Mount Tauriyat was named Eventide, and it was the home of Kiral, the King of Kings. Not only was it the highest and largest of Sharakhai&#x2019;s palaces, it was the most difficult to penetrate. Its walls stood higher than any other palace. Its western side was built atop a sheer rock face, making it near impossible for any sizable force to approach from that angle. Watch towers stood like sentinels every fifty paces, and the winding road leading up to it had a gorge spanned by a drawbridge that, unlike many of the other palaces on Tauriyat, was often raised. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not that the palace had never been breached. With enough preparation, training, and, not least of all, patience, a woman or man could pierce any wall, gain any fortress. There were stories of the Moonless Host having done so many years ago. Whether or not they&#x2019;d grown in the telling was anyone&#x2019;s guess, but one thing was certain: gaining the walls was only the first of their difficulties. There were the Silver Spears to contend with. There were the elite Blade Maidens, who protected the King. And there was the King himself who, even after four hundred years walking the sands of the desert, was still one of the Shangazi&#x2019;s most feared fighters. <br> &nbsp;<br> Careful not to rock the leafy branches, �eda leaned to one side to get a better look at a tall soldier marching along the parapet. A second Spear fol�lowed several paces behind, his helm and the tip of his tall spear glinting gold from the remains of the dying sun. From their high vantage, the two soldiers studied the vertical drop below them. Their gazes roamed the dry slope of the mountain. They stared out past the walls circumnavigating the whole of Tau�riyat, to the sprawl of the Amber City. �eda could see the city as well, an expanse of choked streets and mismatched buildings, of grand temples and leaning hovels. Some were old, some were new, some large, some small, some rich, some so decrepit they looked as if they&#x2019;d crumble the moment the next sandstorm hit. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda&#x2019;s heart drummed as a hot breeze picked up and wind tossed the leaves. One of the guards was staring right at her. The tree, one of dozens in a grove below Eventide, did much to hide her, as did her supple leather armor, which was dyed a mottled color that matched both the fig tree&#x2019;s bark and the rocky soil. She&#x2019;d made the armor with padding that rounded her stomach, chest, and arms, making her appear bigger than she was. She&#x2019;d bound her breasts and stuffed boots too large for her feet to make anyone who spotted her think she was a man. She was not only prepared to be seen before the night was done; she counted on it. Only, it wasn&#x2019;t supposed to happen <i>now</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> She stared at the guard, breathless, certain he&#x2019;d spotted her, but a moment later he spat over the wall, said something to his comrade, and moved on, the two of them laughing with the sort of ease that was common to the shisha dens sprinkled all across the Amber City. Indeed, as if the thought had summoned the city awake, drums and music lifted into the warm evening air, some celebration now underway. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Spears were soon lost from sight, swallowed by the gaping entrance of the next tower, and finally �eda relaxed. Still, her confidence was begin�ning to erode. Where were the other Kings? They should have been here by now. The urge to abandon this plan as too bold and return to the House of Maidens was growing, but a night like tonight wasn&#x2019;t going to come again. She&#x2019;d known weeks ago that she would come; it was practically a directive from the gods themselves, or if not the gods, then surely the fates. <br> &nbsp;<br> When the sun set and the air began to cool, �eda worried the moment had come and gone. Perhaps King Yusam&#x2019;s diary had been wrong. Or in her haste she&#x2019;d noted the wrong date. But just then the sound of galloping horses drew her attention to King&#x2019;s Road, the paved road of endless switchbacks that wound its way like a serpent up the slopes of Tauriyat to each of the Kings&#x2019; palaces. Twelve other palaces graced the mountain, but it was from Husamett�n&#x2019;s, the King of Swords, palace that an honor guard of ten Blade Maidens and a large black wagon emerged. <br> &nbsp;<br> A cavalcade of moths began to flutter in the space between �eda&#x2019;s ribs as the wagon wended its way higher along the palace road. Eyes fixed on the wagon like an archer taking aim, �eda pulled the teardrop necklace from inside her armor, took a white-and-blue adichara petal from within, and placed it under her tongue. She&#x2019;d no sooner clipped the locket closed than her awareness began to expand. <br> &nbsp;<br> Like the perfect unfurling of a freshly cut rose, more of the world became known to her. The conversations of the men and women preparing for the arrival of the other Kings&#x2014; conversations hidden from her only moments ago&#x2014; now drifted down from Eventide. The smell of roast meat filled the air, as did a savory mix of garlic, onion, and the sharp scents of lemon and cori�ander and sage. A thrill ran through her. Her physical form became vibrant, white hot. She <i>itched </i>to use it. <br> &nbsp;<br> The most subtle effect, and the most dangerous on this particular night, was her awareness of the blooming fields. These were the groves of twisted trees, the vast ring around Sharakhai where the asirim slept. Like torches in the night, they brightened in her mind. Ever since she was young, when her mother had begun feeding her bits of pressed petals on holy days or during other rites of passage, she had been bonded to the adichara. She hadn&#x2019;t known their nature then, but she did now. She could feel the asirim in their slumber, could sense their tortured dreams. <br> &nbsp;<br> She could call to them if she wished&#x2014; they&#x2019;d granted her that power&#x2014; but that wasn&#x2019;t what she needed tonight. Like the guards above, it was imperative they remain unaware of her. After all, were the Jackal King to sense her pres�ence here, all would be lost. So instead of calling to them, she distanced herself, becoming something ephemeral, spindrift lifting then lost. <br> &nbsp;<br> The distant thump of horse hooves came louder as the wagon team and the Maidens&#x2019; horses approached the entrance to Eventide. When they were lost from view and the clatter of the entrance bridge being lowered filled the cool night air, �eda stared up at the palace wall and saw a lone guard stand�ing at attention along the western side, facing inward. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Bless you, Nalamae. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Low and fast, she raced to the rock face. Upon reaching it she climbed, using the path she&#x2019;d mapped for herself while waiting for the sun to set. Up she went, quickly, quietly, her body tight to the stone, arms and legs moving smoothly. She was a good climber without the power of the petals driving her, but with it, she reached the lower stone blocks of Eventide&#x2019;s walls in as little time as it took a man to piss. She moved slower then, careful to find space for the tips of her fingers to grip, for the edges of her boots to find purchase. <br> &nbsp;<br> From within the walls, echoing up into a sky bursting with stars, came the sound of pounding hooves, of iron-rimmed wagon wheels rattling over stone. She approached the top of the wall and slowly raised herself until she could see the Silver Spear. With care, she drew a pre-knotted rope from around her waist and slipped one end over the merlon directly above her. The other end, wound into a noose, she held at the ready. She made a ticking sound and waited, controlling her breath, controlling her emotions. When the Spear remained standing at the ready, she made the sound again. This time he looked out over the wall, then down. <br> &nbsp;<br> She was already swinging the rope up. It caught him neatly around the neck. Immediately she dropped, and the guard dropped with her. The noose cinched tight and he slipped over the side, arms scrabbling for purchase. His spear spun end over end toward the fig trees below. The rope went taut, and he swung like a headman&#x2019;s axe toward the wall. �eda slid along the rope so that his weight struck her instead of crashing noisily against stone. Something along his belt bit into her stomach, but he made blessedly little sound as he slammed into her. A cough escaped her, loud enough that she might have been heard. She switched her grip from the rope to the collar of his hauberk. All her weight was on him now, the noose drawing even tighter. He tried to free himself, tried to draw the knife at his belt, but it was a simple matter to snatch his wrist. The noose was so tight he didn&#x2019;t so much as gurgle. She heard a popping sound, though, and then another. A moment later, his whole body went slack. <br> &nbsp;<br> Like an ungainly ladder, she climbed his meaty frame until she was able to grab the rope, stand on his shoulders, and ascend once more. She prayed no cries of alarm would be raised as she slipped through the crenel and belly-crawled into the nearby tower. <br> &nbsp;<br> Hearing none, she rose up until she could view the courtyard through the loophole in the tower. She watched as the wagon lurched to a stop. The team of horses at the lead shook their manes as four Blade Maidens dismounted and moved to stand beside the wagon. A footman in King Kiral&#x2019;s blue livery opened the wagon doors, and three men stepped out, the Maidens and the footman bowing their heads to each. The first was the tall form of Husamett�n, King of Swords. Next came Mesut, the Jackal King, lord of the asirim. And lastly, Cahil, the Confessor King. Mesut and Cahil wore the fine clothes of the Kings of Sharakhai: khalats of vibrant cloth and thread of gold with turbans to match. In contrast, Husamett�n wore simpler clothes&#x2014; the utilitarian sort a desert shaikh might wear&#x2014; but he had a most impressive sword at his side. Night&#x2019;s Kiss, the two-handed shamshir granted him by Goezhen himself. <br> &nbsp;<br> Only when they had all exited the wagon did a fourth King appear. He came from the palace with three Blade Maidens waking in unison behind him. He was a tall, clean-shaven man. Even from this distance �eda could see the pockmarks on his skin, evidence of some childhood disease that had struck well over four hundred years ago. This was Kiral himself, the one all the other Kings deferred to&#x2014; or so �eda had thought before entering the House of Maidens. She&#x2019;d heard rumors of various rifts between the Kings since entering the House four months earlier. None of the other Kings would challenge his authority outright, but some would shed no tears were the Dawn King to topple from his lofty perch. <br> &nbsp;<br> For a time the four Kings spoke, their conversation lost in the clop of hooves as the Maidens&#x2019; horses were led away. The wagon, however, remained. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s begin,&#x201d; Kiral said as the noise dwindled. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda pulled the short bow from her shoulder as King Mesut nodded to the interior of the wagon. At this, a Silver Spear exited, holding a chain in one hand. When he drew on the chain, it clinked, and a woman stumbled into view. As she took the steps, her miserable state was revealed. The chain was affixed to a leather collar around her neck. She was gagged. Her hands were bound behind her, and her breath came jackal-quick. She was trembling, and yet she stood tall before King Kiral; she stared defiantly into his eyes. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda had been pulling one of the four poison-tipped arrows from the quiver on her back, but she halted at this strange occurrence. Two months ago she&#x2019;d stolen into King Yusam&#x2019;s private offices and read through his journal, the one he used to record the visions from the magical pool secreted away in his palace, his mere. The entries were snippets mostly, the most memorable bits and pieces he used to remind him of the things he&#x2019;d seen. This meeting, on this particular day, had been mentioned several times. He had not, however, mentioned this woman, which meant either that he&#x2019;d not seen it or had chosen to withhold it; she had no idea which it might be. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where shall we begin?&#x201d; Mesut asked. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda knew the answer even before Kiral waved to the patch of gravel situated between the greenhouse and the tower where she hid. The greenhouse had been mentioned in the journal. <br> &nbsp;<br> Indeed, they moved to that exact location, four calm Kings and the terri�fied woman. &#x201c;Kneel,&#x201d; Mesut said. When the woman didn&#x2019;t, Cahil kicked the backs of her legs out from under her so she fell to her knees. As he moved behind her and sliced through her bonds to free her hands, �eda placed the arrow across her bow and nocked it. She held it at the ready, staring through the loophole in sick fascination. She thought of releasing the arrow now but, Nalamae forgive her, this was too important. She had to know more. The mere wouldn&#x2019;t have shown it to Yusam if it wasn&#x2019;t vital to him or the Kings or Sharakhai itself. If she revealed herself too soon, they would only perform this strange ritual another time, and she&#x2019;d be none the wiser. So she waited as Cahil unstoppered a glass flask filled with a brown, muddy liquid. Waited as Mesut untied the gag and wrenched her head back. When they began pour�ing it down her throat, however, �eda lifted the bow and drew the arrow back. <br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, the flask was drained. Cahil stepped back, and Mesut let the woman go. She fell slowly to the ground, gripped in pain. She balled her hands into fists, struck them against the ground, as if waging a terrible battle within. But this was a battle already lost. Before �eda&#x2019;s eyes, the woman&#x2019;s skin shriveled. Her cheeks grew sunken. Her hands became skeletal. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>By Bakhi&#x2019;s bright hammer, what did Cahil give her?&nbsp;</i></p></p><h2>Systematic Theology, Volume 3</h2><p>Wolfhart Pannenberg is widely regarded as one of the foremost Christian thinkers of this century.

Hummel sets these controversies in historical perspective by telling the fascinating stories of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton. Through their eyes we see how science flourished and floundered under the influence fo the church, setting the scene for modern conflicts. Then Hummel turns to the Bible, discussing its relationship to science, the place of miracles and the biblical account of the origin of the universe.

J. Jackson Lears draws on a wealth of primary sources �&#x20ac;&#x201d; sermons, diaries, letters �&#x20ac;&#x201d; as well as novels, poems, and essays to explore the origins of turn-of-the-century American antimodernism. He examines the retreat to the exotic, the pursuit of intense physical or spiritual experiences, and the search for cultural self-sufficiency through the Arts and Crafts movement. Lears argues that their antimodern impulse, more pervasive than historians have supposed, was not "simple escapism," but reveals some enduring and recurring tensions in American culture.<br><br>"It's an understatement to call <i>No Place of Grace</i> a brilliant book. . . . It's the first clear sign I've seen that my generation, after marching through the '60s and jogging through the '70s might be pausing to examine what we've learned, and to teach it."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;Walter Kendrick, <i>Village Voice</i><br><br>"One can justly make the claim that <i>No Place of Grace</i> restores and reinterprets a crucial part of American history.

In The Purity Myth Jessica Valenti argues that the country&#x2019;s intense focus on chastity is damaging to young women. Through in-depth cultural and social analysis, Valenti reveals that powerful messaging on both extremes ranging from abstinence curriculum to Girls Gone Wild&#x201d; infomercials place a young woman&#x2019;s worth entirely on her sexuality. Morals are therefore linked purely to sexual behavior, rather than values like honesty, kindness, and altruism. Valenti sheds light on the value and hypocrisy around the notion that girls remain virgin until they&#x2019;re married by putting into context the historical question of purity, modern abstinence-only education, pornography, and public punishments for those who dare to have sex. The Purity Myth presents a revolutionary argument that girls and women are overly valued for their sexuality, as well as solutions for a future without a damaging emphasis on virginity.<br></p><p>Jessica Valenti is the founder and Executive Editor of Feministing.com, and the author of Full Frontal Feminism and The Purity Myth. Her writing has appeared in many publications including The Guardian, and in 2007 she was named one of Elle magazine&#39;s 2007 IntELLEgentsia. She lives in Astoria, New York.Making a cult of virginity via media stereotyping and &#x201c;abstinence-only&#x201d; sex education damages young women, Valenti says, and rolls back women&#x2019;s rights by emphasizing sexuality and deprecating personal character. Furthermore, the book&#x2019;s most thought-provoking chapter points up an insidious connection between chastity and pornography: &#x201c;the porning of America&#x201d; is vital to those in the virginity movement, which needs increasingly available hard-core porn to justify its extreme regressivism. The dangerous belief that a woman&#x2019;s primary value is sexual underlies the objectification and sexualization at the heart of the virginity movement&#x2019;s agenda of controlling and defining women, Valenti maintains. When young women see their bodies and sexuality as commodities, that isn&#x2019;t caused by porn culture but by &#x201c;a larger societal message that . . . their sexuality is not their own.&#x201d; So, is a &#x201c;post-virgin world&#x201d; possible? Full of piercing insight and wit (recalling her own sexual initiation, Valenti quips, &#x201c;I fail to see how anything that lasts less than five minutes can have such an indelible ethical impact&#x201d;), this is an important addition to women&#x2019;s studies. --Whitney Scott</p><h2>Peril on the Royal Train (Railway Detective, 10)</h2><p>Spring, 1858.

A backlist standard; a top 3 cookbook bestseller for us annually.</p><p>The first edition of this classic, published in 1973, introduced Americans to the principles of heart-healthy cooking. Now, more detailed nutritional analysis, more generous use of ethnic ingredients and simplified recipes increase the usefulness of the book. Tips on shopping, cooking and adapting dishes to conform to the AHA's dietary guidelines launch it, followed by chapters on appetizers, soups, salads, fish, poultry, game, meat, vegetarian entrees and the rest of the gamut. More than 500 pages let the home cook devise varied meal plans that accommodate restricted diets, while offering succinct nutritional summaries for each dish. Old-fashioned cooking is given a "lite" touch. Beef Stroganoff made with nonfat tomato juice instead of heaps of sour cream, and rice pudding made with skim milk show that even basic recipes need not be dull. The editors don't, however, annotate recipes regarding their origins or pigeonhole special ingredients; thus, a recipes for "tanjulin," or mandarin orange pudding, provides no clue as to its provenance.

He traveled far and wide, learning about the world below the surface. After years of toil, he created a great map of the underworld and expected to live happily ever after. But did he? Simon Winchester (<i>The Professor and the Madman</i>) tells the fossil-friendly fairy tale life of William Smith in <i>The Map That Changed the World</i>.<p> Born to humble parents, Smith was also a child of the Industrial Revolution (the year of his birth, 1769, also saw Josiah Wedgwood open his great factory, Etruria, Richard Arkwright create his first water-powered cotton-spinning frame, and James Watt receive the patent for the first condensing steam engine). While working as surveyor in a coal mine, Smith noticed the abrupt changes in the layers of rock as he was lowered into the depths. He came to understand that the different layers--in part as revealed by the fossils they contained--always appeared in the same order, no matter where they were found. He also realized that geology required a three-dimensional approach. Smith spent the next 20 some years traveling throughout Britain, observing the land, gathering data, and chattering away about his theories to those he met along the way, thus acquiring the nickname "Strata Smith." In 1815 he published his masterpiece: an 8.5- by 6-foot, hand-tinted map revealing "A Delineation of the Strata of England and Wales."</p><p> Despite this triumph, Smith's road remained more rocky than smooth. Snubbed by the gentlemanly Geological Society, Smith complained that "the theory of geology is in the possession of one class of men, the practice in another." Indeed, some members of the society went further than mere ostracism--they stole Smith's work. These cartographic plagiarists produced their own map, remarkably similar to Smith's, in 1819. Meanwhile the chronically cash-strapped Smith had been forced to sell his prized fossil collection and was eventually consigned to debtor's prison.</p><p> In the end, the villains are foiled, our hero restored, and science triumphs. Winchester clearly relishes his happy ending, and his honey-tinged prose ("that most attractively lovable losterlike Paleozoic arthropod known as the trilobite") injects a lot of life into what seems, on the surface, a rather dry tale. Like Smith, however, Winchester delves into the strata beneath the surface and reveals a remarkable world. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Simon Winchester is an award-winning journalist who now lives in New York.

A small skeleton wrapped in pornographic magazines is unearthed--along with questions about Chester&#39;s involvement in a series of child murders.</p><p>In the second installment of the Hap Collins-Leonard Pine series, Leonard is still recuperating from the injuries he suffered in the first book (<i>Savage Season</i>) when he learns that his Uncle Chester has died. Hap agrees to stay with Leonard and help clean out the rundown house that he's inherited; when they find a small skeleton buried under the floor, it's up to them to prove that Chester wasn't responsible for a string of child murders by finding the real killer.<p> Lansdale slowly develops the relationship between his two protagonists as they banter with each other throughout their pursuit of the killers. <i>Mucho Mojo</i> also introduces two other characters, LaBorde Police Department members Lieutenant Marvin Hanson and his sidekick, Charlie, who serve as ongoing sources of friction--and, when it's most needed, support.</p>Where does Mojo storytelling come from? How does a fella learn tospin over-the-top yarns of any sort: horror, suspense, humor, science fiction, Western, what have you? First you got to see the world, like champion Mojo storyteller Joe R. Lansdale, who has lived everywhere from Gladewater, Texas to Mount Enterprise, Texas to Nacogdoches, Texas! &#34;Texas is so wrapped up in myth and legend, it&#39;s hard to know what the state and its people are really about,&#34; says Lansdale. &#34;Real Texans, raised on these myths and legends, sometimes become legends themselves. The bottom line is, Texas and its people are pretty much what most people mean when they use the broader term &#39;America.&#39; No state better represents the independent spirit, the can-do attitude of America, better than Texas.&#34; The second ingredient to good Mojo storytelling is learning how to take a punch. Or a kick. Or a poke in the eye. And then learning how to avoid them. Lansdale is a student of the martial arts for more than thirty years. He&#39;s a two-time inductee into the International Martial Arts Hall of Fame, one such honor bestowed upon him for his founding of Shen Chuan, Martial Science. He holds belts in Daito Ryu Aikijujutsu, Combat Hapkido, American Combat Kempo, and Aikido, amongst others; in fact, his standard day is six hours at the typewriter, three hours at Lansdale&#39;s Self Defense Systems, the martial-arts studio which he owns and at which he teaches. With more than twenty books to his credit-and 200 short stories-Joe R. Lansdale is the champion Mojo storyteller. He&#39;s been called &#34;the Stephen King of Texas&#34; by Texas Monthly; &#34;an immense talent&#34; by Booklist; &#34;a born storyteller&#34; by Robert Bloch; and The New York Times Book Review declares he has &#34;a folklorist&#39;s eye for telling detail and a front-porch raconteur&#39;s sense of pace.&#34; He&#39;s won umpty-ump awards, including five Bram Stoker horror awards, a British Fantasy Award, the American Mystery Award, the Horror Critics Award, the &#34;Shot in the Dark&#34;. International Crime Writer&#39;s award, the Booklist Editor&#39;s Award, the Critic&#39;s Choice Award, and a New York Times Notable Book award. He&#39;s got the most decorated mantle in all of Nacogdoches! Lansdale lives in Nacogdoches, Texas, with his wife, Karen-an occasional writer and editor-and their son and daughter, Keith and Kasey.</p><h2>A Field Guide to Western Mushrooms</h2><p>A guide to finding and identifying mushrooms found west of the Great Plains<br></p><p></p><h2>Have a New Kid by Friday: How to Change Your Child's Attitude, Behaviour &amp; Character in 5 Days</h2><p>This is a brand new paperback book.</p><p><b>Change your child's behavior--fast!<br></b><br>Want a kid without the attitude?

The son of a wealthy German textile manufacturer, Engels had acquired an intimate knowledge of the processes of Industrial Revolution-type capitalism and of the oppressed conditions of the bulk of the working class while working in Manchester at his father&#39;s factory. The Condition of the Working Class in England stands alongside such other of Engels&#39;&#39; works as &#34;Socialism: Utopian and Scientific&#34; and &#34;The Dialectic of Nature&#34; as one of the classic texts of Marxist thought. It is a vitally important political, social and historical document, written out of a deep humanity and with great analytic skill.</p><p>Frederick Engels (1820-1895), the son of a wealthy German textile manufacturer, moved in 1842 to England to take a position in a factory near Manchester partially owned by his father. Engels met Karl Marx in 1844 and began a lifelong association with him. The two are considered to be the founders of modern communism. The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845; English translation 1847) is one of the classic texts of Marxist thought, standing besides such other of Engels&#39; works as Socialism: Utopian and Scientific and The Dialectic of Nature. It is a vitally important political, social and historical document.Engels was a social philosopher and one of the founders of Socialism and Communism. He collaborated with the famous revolutionary Karl Marx and founded Workingmen&#39;s Association. His work reflects animosity for the Capitalists and sympathy for working class.</p><h2>A Humument: A Treated Victorian Novel, Fourth Edition</h2><p>In the mid-1960s, inspired by William Burroughs's "cut-up" writing technique, Tom Phillips bought an obscure Victorian novel for three penceW. H. Mallock's 1892 novel, <i>A Human Document</i>. He began cutting and pasting the extant text, treating the pages with gouache and ink, isolating the words that interested him while scoring out unwanted words or painting over them. The result was <i>A Humument</i>, and the first version appeared in 1970. The artist writes, "I plundered, mined, and undermined its text to make it yield the ghosts of other possible stories, scenes, poems, erotic incidents, and surrealist catastrophes which seemed to lurk within its wall of words. As I worked on it, I replaced the text I'd stripped away with visual images of all kinds. It began to tell and depict, among other memories, dreams, and reflections, the sad story of Bill Toge, one of love's casualties." After its first publication in book form in 1980, <i>A Humument</i> rapidly became a cult classic. Phillips has continued to revisit Mallock's novel, and this new fourth edition follows its predecessors by incorporating revisions and reworkingsover a hundred pages are replaced by new versionsand celebrates an artistic enterprise that is itself some forty years old and still actively a work in progress. 368 color illustrations.</p><p><b>Tom Phillips</b> is an English painter, writer, and composer whose other books include <i>Words and Texts</i>.A visual adventure, a peculiar space where the reader-spectator is invited to speculate on the meaning of words and images. -- <i><i>ARTnews</i></i><br><br>A wonderful entertainment...full of humor, visual invention, and the peculiar poignancy of unnoticed meanings. -- <i><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></i><br><br>It may be the closest a paperback book has come to being an art object. -- <i><i>New York</i></i><br><br>One of the more winning and witty artistic experiments of recent times. -- <i><i>Washington Post</i></i><br><br>Outbursts of words that find themselves in an altogether new syntactical space; there, like notes, they sing a painted music. -- <i>William A.

It's also one long in-joke about the movie industry and those who made it great-and who were, in turn, destroyed by it. One of the most critically admired films of the twentieth century, <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> is also famous as silent star Gloria Swanson's comeback picture.<br><br><i>Close-Up On Sunset Boulevard</i> tells the story of this extravagant work, from the writing, casting and filming to the disastrous previews that made Paramount consider shelving it. It's about the writing team of Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett-sardonically called "the happiest couple in Hollywood"-and their raucous professional relationship. It's about the art direction and the sets, the costumes, the props, the lights and the cameras, and the personalities who used those tools to create a cinematic work of art.<br><br>Staggs goes behind the scenes to reveal: William Holden, endlessly attacked by his bitter wife and already drinking too much; Nancy Olson, the cheerful ingenue who had never heard of the great Gloria Swanson; the dark genius Erich von Stroheim; the once famous but long-forgotten "Waxworks"; and of course Swanson herself, who-just like Norma Desmond-had once been "the greatest star of them all."<br><br>But the story of <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> doesn't end with the movie's success and acclaim at its release in l950. There's much more, and Staggs layers this stylish book with fascinating detail, following the actors and Wilder into their post-<i>Sunset</i> careers and revealing Gloria Swanson's never-ending struggle to free herself from the clutches of Norma Desmond.<br><br><i>Close-Up On Sunset Boulevard</i> also chronicles the making of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical production of <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> and the explosive diva controversies that dogged it. The book ends with a shocking example of Hollywood life imitating Hollywood art. By the last page of this rich narrative, readers will conclude: We are those "wonderful people out there in the dark."<br></p><p>Sam Staggs is the author of the acclaimed <i>All About All About Eve</i> and a novel, <i>MMII: The Return of Marilyn Monroe</i>. He lives in Dallas, Texas.<br>Staggs serves up another round of popcorn in this highly enjoyable follow-up to All About "All About Eve," plumbing the depths of the noir homage to the silent era, Sunset Boulevard. The book traces the film's history from the studio pairing of Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett as screenwriters to the Academy Award disappointments to the film's rebirth as an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical in the 1990s. Staggs's research is impressive: in addition to traditional print sources, he tapped unexpected sources, such as the film's previously uninterviewed supporting actress Nancy Olson, and explored nifty locales, like Norma Desmond's would-be neighborhood. The intrepid reporting results in little-known film facts: how co-art director John Meehan conceived and set up the face-down water shot of the dead Joe Gillis (William Holden) and why then-megastar Montgomery Clift did not want to play opposite older female character Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Also entertaining are Staggs's descriptions of the many behind-the-scenes cat fights. Some of Staggs's film analysis such as his take on the "crowd-pleasing kitsch" sound movies of Cecil B. DeMille is standard, but his opinions on the Wilder-Brackett and Wilder-I.A.L. Diamond pairings are sharp and original. There are also plenty of edifying sidebars on topics such as the history of Norma Desmond's exotic car (the Isotta-Fraschini), changes made to the script and "Smiling Franklyn Farnum," the silent western star who plays Norma Desmond's pet undertaker. Staggs has succeeded in presenting another remarkable film study.

Reprint.</p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesThe Pump House Gang<br><br>Our boys never hair out. The black panther has black feet. Black feet on the crumbling black panther. Pan-thuh. Mee-dah. Pam Stacy, 16 years old, a cute girl here in La Jolla, California, with a pair of orange bell-bottom hip-huggers on, sits on a step about four steps down the stairway to the beach and she can see a pair of revolting black feet without lifting her head. So she says it out loud, "The black panther."<br><br>Somebody farther down the stairs, one of the boys with the major hair and khaki shorts, says, "The black feet of the black panther."<br><br>"Mee-dah," says another kid. This happens to be the cry of a, well, underground society known as the Mac Meda Destruction Company.<br><br>"The pan-thuh."<br><br>"The poon-thuh."<br><br>All these kids, seventeen of them, members of the Pump House crowd, are lollygagging around the stairs down to Windansea Beach, La Jolla, California, about 11 a.m., and they all look at the black feet, which are a woman's pair of black street shoes, out of which stick a pair of old veiny white ankles, which lead up like a senile cone to a fudge of tallowy, edematous flesh, her thighs, squeezing out of her bathing suit, with old faded yellow bruises on them, which she probably got from running eight feet to catch a bus or something. She is standing with her old work-a-hubby, who has on sandals: you know, a pair of navy-blue anklet socks and these sandals with big, wide, new-smelling tan straps going this way and that, for keeps. Man, they look like orthopedic sandals, if one can imagine that. Obviously, these people come from Tucson or Albuquerque or one of those hincty adobe towns. All these hincty, crumbling black feet come to La Jolla-by-the-sea from the adobe towns for the weekend. They even drive in cars all full of thermos bottles and mayonnaisey sandwiches and some kind of latticework wooden-back support for the old crock who drives and Venetian blinds on the back window.<br><br>"The black panther."<br><br>"Pan-thuh."<br><br>"Poon-thuh."<br><br>"Mee-dah."<br><br>Nobody says it to the two old crocks directly. God, they must be practically 50 years old. Naturally, they're carrying every piece of garbage imaginable: the folding aluminum chairs, the newspapers, the lending-library book with the clear plastic wrapper on it, the sunglasses, the sun ointment, about a vat of goo--<br><br>It is a Mexican standoff. In a Mexican standoff, both parties narrow their eyes and glare but nobody throws a punch. Of course, nobody in the Pump House crowd would ever even jostle these people or say anything right to them; they are too cool for that.<br><br>Everybody in the Pump House crowd looks over, even Tom Coman, who is a cool person. Tom Coman, 16 years old, got thrown out of his garage last night. He is sitting up on top of the railing, near the stairs, up over the beach, with his legs apart. Some nice long willowy girl in yellow slacks is standing on the sidewalk but leaning into him with her arms around his body, just resting. Neale Jones, 16, a boy with great lank perfect surfer's hair, is standing nearby with a Band-Aid on his upper lip, where the sun has burnt it raw. Little Vicki Ballard is up on the sidewalk. Her older sister, Liz, is down the stairs by the Pump House itself, a concrete block, 15 feet high, full of machinery for the La Jolla water system. Liz is wearing her great "Liz" styles, a hulking rabbit-fur vest and black-leather boots over her Levi's, even though it is about 85 out here and the sun is plugged in up there like God's own dentist lamp and the Pacific is heaving in with some fair-to-middling surf. Kit Tilden is lollygagging around, and Tom Jones, Connie Carter, Roger Johnson, Sharon Sandquist, Mary Beth White, Rupert Fellows, Glenn Jackson, Dan Watson from San Diego, they are all out here, and everybody takes a look at the panthers.<br><br>The old guy, one means, you know, he must be practically 50 years old, he says to his wife, "Come on, let's go farther up," and he takes her by her fat upper arm as if to wheel her around and aim her away from here.<br><br>But she says, "No! We have just as much right to be here as they do."<br><br>"That's not the point--"<br><br>"Are you going to--"<br><br>"Mrs. Roberts," the work-a-hubby says, calling his own wife by her official married name, as if to say she took a vow once and his word is law, even if he is not testing it with the blond kids here--"farther up, Mrs. Roberts."<br><br>They start to walk up the sidewalk, but one kid won't move his feet, and, oh, god, her work-a-hubby breaks into a terrible shaking Jell-O smile as she steps over them, as if to say, Excuse me, sir, I don't mean to make trouble, please, and don't you and your colleagues rise up and jump me, screaming Gotcha--<br><br>Mee-dah!<br><br>But exactly! This beach is verboten for people practically 50 years old. This is a segregated beach. They can look down on Windansea Beach and see nothing but lean tan kids. It is posted "no swimming" (for safety reasons), meaning surfing only. In effect, it is segregated by age. From Los Angeles on down the California coast, this is an era of age segregation. People have always tended to segregate themselves by age, teenagers hanging around with teenagers, old people with old people, like the old men who sit on the benches up near the Bronx Zoo and smoke black cigars. But before, age segregation has gone on within a larger community. Sooner or later during the day everybody has melted back into the old community network that embraces practically everyone, all ages.<br><br>But in California today surfers, not to mention rock 'n' roll kids and the hot-rodders or Hair Boys, named for their fanciful pompadours--all sorts of sets of kids--they don't merely hang around together. They establish whole little societies for themselves. In some cases they live with one another for months at a time. The "Sunset Strip" on Sunset Boulevard used to be a kind of Times Square for Hollywood hot dogs of all ages, anyone who wanted to promenade in his version of the high life. Today "The Strip" is almost completely the preserve of kids from about 16 to 25. It is lined with go-go clubs. One of them, a place called It's Boss, is set up for people 16 to 25 and won't let in anybody over 25, and there are some terrible I'm-dying-a-thousand-deaths scenes when a girl comes up with her boyfriend and the guy at the door at It's Boss doesn't think she looks under 25 and tells her she will have to produce some identification proving she is young enough to come in here and live The Strip kind of life and--she's had it, because she can't get up the I.D. and nothing in the world is going to make a woman look stupider than to stand around trying to argue I'm younger than I look, I'm younger than I look. So she practically shrivels up like a Peruvian shrunken head in front of her boyfriend and he trundles her off, looking for some place you can get an old doll like this into. One of the few remaining clubs for "older people," curiously, is the Playboy Club. There are apartment houses for people 20 to 30 only, such as the Sheri Plaza in Hollywood and the E'Questre Inn in Burbank. There are whole suburban housing developments, mostly private developments, where only people over 45 or 50 can buy a house. Whole towns, meantime, have become identified as "young": Venice, Newport Beach, Balboa--or "old": Pasadena, Riverside, Coronado Island.</p><h2>The Present</h2><p>The carefully wrapped present was perched half-hidden on his parents' closet shelf. Arthur, a little boy with a very large imagination, feverishly tried to guess what it might contain. A pet? A shiny trumpet? A new computer? The possibilities were almost endless. All for him and him alone&#x20ac;&#x201d;until the doorbell interrupted his reverie. What happened next is a remarkable and soul-satisfying reminder that the act of sharing is perhaps the greatest present of all. A simple and timeless tale of spontaneous generosity, told with understated humor, a great warmth and a brilliantly direct graphic stylewhich go to the very heart of the human experience. With the gentle insight of A Cup of Christmas Tea and the resonant innocence of The Giving Tree, Bob Gill's book is destined to become a best-loved gift about gift-giving.</p><p>Brooklyn-born Bob Gill&#39;s work as an artist and graphic designer has spanned continents; his genius has been stamped on a wide range of creative endeavors, from children&#39;s books and award-winning international ad campaigns to Beatlemania. He lives in New York City.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;Young Arthur's birthday is approaching and, while rummaging around his father's closet, he notices a present on the top shelf that he presumes is for him. He begins imagining what the box might contain: perhaps a backpack, possibly "a gazillion chocolate bars," maybe a volleyball. Though readers never see the child, they learn about him through his musings: his house is near a park with a pond; he has friends, owns a bicycle, and dislikes bowling; and has an aunt, an uncle, and two parents. But what is quite significant about Arthur will be discovered on the last page. Most of the graphic illustrations contain a large picture of each of the various objects the boy imagines; some appear only in black and white and others in bright colors, outlined in black. This seemingly simple story will lead to discussions about the rewards of giving and/or receiving.&#x2014;<i>Maryann H.

The book was chosen for publication from more than 100 manuscript submissions. A richly textured story of love and murder, <i>One Foot in Eden</i> unfolds through the distinctive voices of a small-town sheriff, a young married couple, and those who share in their secrets. Sheriff Will Alexander knows who murdered Holland Winchester, but he can't find the body and no one's talking, least of all Holland's neighbor, Billy Holcombe. And Billy's pretty wife Amy seems to know something about it, too. For years, the mystery will go unsolved-until the day the power company forces everyone out and floods the valley and family farms where this close-knit community has lived and worked for generations. Rash is a native Appalachian, and writes with deep understanding and affection for a region often misunderstood. The story is a tribute to a time, place, and way of life slowly vanishing from the modern South.</p><p>Ron Rash teaches English at TriCounty Technical College in Pendleton, S.C., and teaches poetry in the Queens College M.F.A. program in Charlotte, N.C. His other published works include three books of poetry, two collections of short stories, and a children&#39;s book. In 1994 he was awarded an NEA Fellowship."A classic tale of passion and tragedy. Each voice rings as true as the sound of an ax in the cold early morning air." --Lee Smith, author of <i>The Last Girls</i><br><br>"Equal parts vintage crime novel and Southern Gothic, full of aching ambivalence and hard compromises, and rounded off by bad faith and bad choices, <i>One Foot in Eden</i> is a veritable garden of earthly disquiet." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"Ruggedly beautiful...Reading Rash's tale is like listening to a plaintive mountain ballad about a time and place long vanished: the lyrics are sweet and mournful, wistful and dark. And, oh, does <i>One Foot in Eden</i> linger!" --<i>The Charlotte Observer</i><br><br>"Rash's characters have a heroic quality as they struggle to fill the empty spaces in their hearts. They also have a poetic intensity." --<i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i><br><br>"<i>One Foot In Eden</i> is a story of wild, almost primitive force and yet it is neatly and ingeniously put together. Ron Rash knows to the core the ways of those who yearn for what is just beyond their grasp. Here is a lasting experience."<br>-Fred Chappell, Poet Laureate of North Carolina<br><br>"Ron Rash writes like a prince!"<br>-Pat Conroy<br><br>"<i>One Foot in Eden</i> is a forceful but never forced narrative. Rash moves his tragedy along with great authority, revealing motives that build to the complexity of each character as well as our fascination with them and the outcome of their lives. It is a finely polished novel."<br>-<i>The Columbia State</i><br><br>"If you are a fan of writers such as Robert Morgan, Lee Smith and Fred Chappell, you'll be pleased to know they liked this novel and wrote glowing jacket notes. And no wonder: <i>One Foot In Eden</i> could have been written by any of these authors....Save yourself a nice stretch of time for this book. Once you start it, you will find it extremely hard to put down."<br>-<i>The Anderson Independent</i><br><br>"In this fine, passionate work, Rash combines a murder mystery with the occasion of the flooding of a South Carolina Appalachian valley by Carolina power. The story of <i>One Foot In Eden</i> is simple, elemental. The conclusion has the force and inevitability of real tragedy...a tragedy that occurs in the ancient, brooding mountains of the Southern Appalachians."<br>-Don Noble, Alabama Public Radio<br></p><h2>Chasing The Monsoon</h2><p>An account of the author&#39;s two-month journey in 1987, chasing the summer monsoon through India, from its &#34;burst&#34; near the southernmost tip of the country to its grand finale in a remote hill town on the Bangladeshi border</p><p><b>Alexander Frater</b> is chief travel correspondent for the <i>Observer</i> in London and has written for the <i>New Yorker, Punch</i>, and others. He is also the author of numerous books, including <i>Beyond the Blue Horizon</i>.The monsoon in India is an exalting, inspiring event which heralds the rebirth of greenery. Yet, in chasing the summer monsoon along the coast, journalist Frater ( Stopping-Train in Britain: A Railway Odyssey , LJ 5/1/84) quickly discovers it can turn sinister. The monsoon overpowers technology, bearing disease and floods to an overpopulated land where runoff-preventing asphalt has replaced forests. In his engaging, witty travelog replete with anecdotes and asides, Frater comes to terms with his parents' deaths and learns to accept the Indians' attitude of submission to more powerful forces which, for them, makes the inevitable more bearable. The pleasure of reading this lively book can be enhanced by pairing it with Steve McCurry's spectacular photographic essay Monsoon (Thames &amp; Hudson, dist. by Norton, 1988), which covers other monsoon areas as well as India.

Only Conan dares to stand against them....<br><br>But he is too late?<br></p><p>One<br>&nbsp;<br>The Stowaway<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Messantia's most infamous tavern, the Stowaway, lay unmarked at the city's outskirts amid a cluster of slovenly buildings. It marked the end of Merchant Street, which originated at the busiest harbor in Argos's capital city. At the harbor, the street was wide, paved with stone, and well-maintained by King Milo's taxes. But as it twisted, branched, and wound its way through the largest port city in any of the Hyborian Kingdoms, it dwindled to a narrow strip of dirt that was paved with naught but rubbish and traversed only by a dense population of rats. Here the locals named it Pirate's Lane, for those who trod upon it were less accustomed to hard-packed dirt than to wood-planked deck. They were seafaring rogues: stocky, tawny-haired Argosseans; lean, sallow-skinned Zingarans; and swarthy, black-bearded Shemites.<br>They clustered in the Stowaway's dim, wood-furnished confines like barnacles on a hull. Six of Messantia's boldest smugglers feasted on haunches of flame-roasted mutton, washing down their greasy repast with draughts of thick ale. A swarthy Kothian cutthroat watched them with a predatory gaze, stroking his thick black mustache. A sweaty Shemite captain locked wrist and hand in an arm-wrestling match with a rival Zingaran, while a scarred, tattooed Nemedian collected wagers from the contestants' crewmen.<br>Of course, drinking and gambling were but two of many vices in which the Stowaway's motley patrons engaged.<br>Clad in the scantiest wisps of garments, wenches from a dozen lands moved among the throng, their bared hips swaying provocatively as they served ale, wine, and platters of steaming meat to patrons. Their voluptuous bodies drew many stares, though for the most part, their faces had a hard-eyed, jaded look. The tavern attracted the sort of men who preferred coarse, lusty harlots. Of course, no self-respecting doxy would go near a place with the Stowaway's reputation.<br>One would have to visit a dungeon to find a more ruffianly lot gathered in one room. Even so, the crowd seemed at ease--many of the rogues were bitter rivals at sea, but the Stowaway was neutral ground. Here they rollicked: drinking, wagering, and wenching away their plunder.<br>The crowd tonight was thicker than usual, for the crew of the notorious <i>Hawk</i> had put ashore after months at sea. Her captain was a pirate whose very name was cursed and feared by every seafaring merchant in the region. At the Stowaway's largest table sat this notorious rogue, Conan: a blackmaned, blue-eyed giant from the frozen hills of Cimmeria. His crew--a motley band of villainous scum--surrounded him, laughing lustily as the <i>Hawk</i>'s first mate finished a bawdy lyric.<br>"By Crom, Rulvio, the most jaded strumpet would blush at your jests!" Conan guffawed, thumping the bearlike Argossean on the back.<br>Frothy Argossean ale slopped from Rulvio's leathern jack onto his hairy chest and drenched his baggy silken breeks. The first mate took no notice of the spill, quaffing the rest of his ale in a single gulp and belching thunderously.<br>Conan yelled for more ale. He leaned backward and playfully swatted the shapely backside of Rubinia, the Stowaway's comeliest serving-wench. She giggled and strolled away, her swaying hips and scanty shift turning the head of every man nearby. Conan's eyes drank in the sight wolfishly, and he gulped down another measure of strong ale.<br>"So, Captain," Rulvio rumbled, "say ye that we've enough loot for a fortnight of wenching in Messantia?"<br>"Aye," Conan affirmed. "The <i>Hawk</i> needs an overhaul anyway, and this lot of drunkards--" he nodded toward his sodden crewmen "--is ill-suited for any task save sailing or looting. And after tonight's windfall, the lads earned a good debauch."<br>"I've a mind to float in a sea of ale myself," chuckled Rulvio.<br>"Let's first discuss an urgent matter--privately," added Conan. He nodded toward the smoky shadows of the opposite end of the Stowaway.<br>Many of the <i>Hawk</i>'s crew had begun their debauch in earnest. One band diced, a few others had wenches in their laps, while many drifted to join other patrons, hear news, and swap lies about their adventures. Conan and Rulvio looked on, amused, and wandered to one of many dimly lit nooks in the Stowaway's squalid interior.<br>"'Bel favors the thief what squanders his booty,' eh?" quoth Rulvio. His broad grin revealed teeth as crooked as his nose, which had been broken more times than he could remember.<br>Conan raised a bushy eyebrow. "Were it so, Bel would hold no sea-dog in higher esteem than you, Rulvio." The Cimmerian's blue eyes burned sharply, as if his wits had not yet been clouded by the Argossean ale. He lowered his voice and leaned closer to the golden hoop that dangled from Rulvio's sunburned ear. "We <i>have</i> been through some scrapes together, my friend. You shoved me to the deck and took an arrow in the leg for me, years ago when that Zingaran galley nearly ran us down. For that, I am in your debt."<br>Rulvio shrugged. "Had ye not slain a score of those Zingaran swine when they boarded us, our whole blasted crew would be rotting in Dagon's belly. Hah! There be no debt between us, Conan. I served under Borus before ye, and Gonzago before him, and neither could match ye as captain."<br>Conan accepted the compliment in silence. He demanded much from his men, but he rewarded them with fair shares of every haul. Still, a blood debt could not be settled so readily. And for what he had in mind, he would need the help of a stout fighter like Rulvio.<br>The Argossean's brow furrowed. "This ale has addled my wits, Conan, else I'd have seen it sooner. Why put ashore here, in a city with laws, and not in the Barachan Isles, where they welcome dogs like us?"<br>"Swear by Bel that you will not repeat what I am about to tell you."<br>Rulvio did so, his bloodshot eyes meeting Conan's somber gaze.<br>The Cimmerian withdrew a folded piece of parchment from his vest of supple, finely tooled leather. He laid it upon the table, thumping it with his scarred fist. "I found this in a cloak, aboard that little Zingaran ship we overtook today."<br>"Well, at least ye found something that the lads won't squander tonight," Rulvio said heavily. "Bel knows we'll guzzle the profit from that excursion before the sun rises. I'll not grumble about the cargo, but I would that we had caught the swine who made off in the skiff with the strongbox."<br>Conan waved aside the first mate's complaints. "We could not give chase--the cursed wind deserted us, and that fool Voralo gave chase in our boat and got himself and three lads killed in the process!" The memory stoked a fire of anger in Conan's eyes; the <i>Hawk</i> had eventually caught up with Voralo's drifting boat and its dead occupants, but their slayer had escaped, presumably to the haven afforded by nearby Messantia. Each man's throat had been slit deeply, vertically, their wounds unlike any that even Conan had seen. He chewed his lip for a span, then stared across the table at Rulvio. "But we may yet gain from that raid. Have you heard legends of a City of Brass?"<br>Rulvio snorted. "Aye. Though I be not fool enough to believe them. There's a knave in every blasted town from here to Turan who hawks maps to the Brass City. I doubt not that ye found such a piece of fakery--they be as common as lice in a beggar's beard!"<br>"So they are," Conan agreed, scowling. As a na�ve youth, he had wasted many a coin on false treasure maps. "But this one is different; never have I seen its like. In my wanderings, I have learned a smattering of ancient rune-lore. The map bears inscriptions..." He paused as Rubinia arrived, a huge clay pitcher nestled in the crook of her elbow.<br>Rulvio's eyes had shifted away from Conan's. They lingered on Rubinia's full bosom, which strained at the thin fabric of her low-cut tunic as she bent over their table to refill their ale-jacks. When she finished, the Argossean's gaze followed her. "Forget this mad quest for the blasted Brass City, Captain. Why not spend the evenings carousing with us and pass the nights abed with that doxy until the <i>Hawk</i> is ready to sail again? We be wolves of the sea, and on the sea we hunt--not in the dusty bowels of some landlocked ruin."<br>"You speak wisely, as ever, Rulvio. Assuredly the wench will take my mind off this map for a time. But I deem it worthwhile to spend a week or two on a foray into the desert of Shem, where these writings place the city. Accompany me if you wish. I shall go at it alone if you prefer to stay here--perhaps it were better if you did, or the lads may get into too much trouble."<br>"<i>Our</i> lads?" Rulvio winked. "Why, such refined fellows as they will of course obey every local law and observe every blasted custom." He pointed toward a group of a half-score of loud, inebriated knaves who had stopped throwing dice and started throwing punches. "Fenzini, you slack-wit!" Rulvio cursed. "Use the weighted dice in games with honest folk--not with your blasted mates!" He turned to Conan, grunting disapprovingly. "I must needs break this up before someone dents a skull." He cracked his knuckles as he rose from the wooden crate that served as his seat and staggered into the brawl.<br>Conan shook his head, though he was not too surprised by Rulvio's lack of enthusiasm for a venture into Shem. Still, the Cimmerian was determined to see if the map might open a vault of treasure that for centuries had eluded fortune-hunters. Many times he had single-handedly seized hoards of wealth, the very existence of which had been scoffed at by others. And he knew well that a few nights of revelry would end in restlessness. After months at sea, he welcomed a journey that would take him through Shem's lush wine country.

That is, until Kristabelle starts using the powerful threat of un-inviting children from her ?fantastic? birthday party to keep them in line, and Willow decides she's finally had enough. Surprising everyone, even herself, Willow steps up and bravely does something shocking, and it changes the entire dynamic of the classroom. <br>This child-friendly and relatable story about bullying is elegantly told with honesty and heart. The simple artwork by Tania Howells beautifully captures the subtleties of the story; the children are the main focus of the spare illustrations, allowing their body language and facial expressions to leap off the page and showcase exactly how they're feeling. This is a book that will have young children on the edge of their seats at storytime, deeply sympathetic to the dilemma faced by Willow and her classmates. What makes this book particularly helpful is that it presents a model for how any child, even a shy one like Willow, can find his or her own way to deal with a bossy or bullying classmate. It offers a pitch-perfect lesson on how to stand up for yourself, terrifically aligning with character education lessons on courage. The empowering message here also helps promote individual self-awareness, self-esteem and good decision making.</p><p>Lana Button works in early childhood education.

Willow is thrilled to be on the initial guest list, but she becomes troubled as Kristabelle begins to remove names as children displease her. Willow knows Kristabelle's behavior is cruel and controlling but she just can't find the words or the nerve to tell her. Eventually, she finds the courage to remove her own name from the list, and the rest of her classmates follow suit. This leaves Kristabelle distressed since no one wants to come to her party. The students watch her struggle while learning an important lesson. She then destroys the list and invites all of them to the party. They happily reconsider after recognizing that she has changed her ways. Button has recognized a common childhood dilemma, trying to deal with a peer's controlling personality. She has crafted a story to help children acknowledge and express their feelings while in uncomfortable situations. Howells's artwork is simple and strongly emotional. The conclusion elicits a sigh of relief from readers as the tension in the class is eliminated and the party will go on. A good choice to prompt discussions about friendship, bullying, and self-confidence.-Diane Antezzo, Ridgefield Library, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Leach focuses on the correspondence and scientific writings of half a dozen pioneering lepidopterists who traveled across the country and throughout the world, collecting and studying unknown and exotic species. In a book as full of life as the subjects themselves and foregrounding a collecting culture now on the brink of vanishing, Leach reveals how the beauty of butterflies led Americans into a deeper understanding of the natural world. He shows, too, that the country&#x2019;s enthusiasm for butterflies occurred at the very moment that another form of beauty&#x2014;the technological and industrial objects being displayed at world&#x2019;s fairs and commercial shows&#x2014;was emerging, and that Americans&#x2019; attraction to this new beauty would eventually, and at great cost, take precedence over nature in general and butterflies in particular.</p><p><p><b>A Look Inside <em>Butterfly People</em></b></p> <em> </em> <em>Click here for a larger image</em> <em> </em> <em>Click here for a larger image</em> <em> </em> <em>Click here for a larger image</em> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Guest Review by Robert Michael Pyle</b></p> <p><strong>Robert Michael Pyle is the author of <em>The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies</em> .</strong></p> <p><i>Butterfly People</i> is the most exciting butterfly book I have read in years: open it anywhere, and the pages spread to reveal stories, spangles, and mysteries as beguiling as any butterfly's pattern. Bill Leach takes us on an extraordinary flight among the collectors, scientist- artists, and other pioneers of butterflies who gave us their names, first studied their lifeways, and otherwise brought them to public attention in America and abroad. Everyone who suffers from an unquenchable love of Lepidoptera will find deep delight and endless fascination in Bill Leach's masterful history of this universal human passion for the most beautiful of insects. Dead and dry in books, the names of people intimately associated with our beloved butterflies&#x2014;Edwards, Scudder, Strecker, Holland, many more&#x2014; live and breathe in these enchanted pages. After fifty years of butterfly study, I feel as if I finally know the great and very human lepidopterists I have idolized since boyhood. Nor are they lives of monotonous ecstasy in the Elysian fields&#x2014;ecstasy there is in plenty, but it is set among scenes of salty struggle, venal ego, mortal drama, and heroic striving that, taken altogether, made for the greatest century of butterfly art and understanding ever achieved. I know no better window into the exciting era of Darwinian encounter with novel life forms than this--to be sure, a thrilling read for all contemporary Butterfly People.</p><p><b>William Leach</b> is a professor of history at Columbia University.

She lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and three daughters.Henry Adams<br><br>(1838-1918)<br><br>The great-grandson of President John Adams and the grandson of President John Quincy Adams, Henry Adams was born into American political aristocracy. Like many of his class, the Harvard graduate embarked on the European Grand Tour in 1858--and stayed on the Continent for ten years, writing travel and scholarly articles about his experiences. Eventually, Adams returned to Washington, D.C., and set up a salon in a mansion near the White House. He and his wife, Marian (nicknamed Clover), were the most sought-after invitation in the post-Civil War capital. Their inner circle, called The Five of Hearts, included John and Clara Hay and Clarence King. Adams was shattered by Clover's suicide in 1885, and he resumed his restless traveling--through the Far East, the Caribbean, Mexico, Australia and Europe.<br><br>In 1895 Henry Adams made his first systematic study of the architecture of Mont St. Michel and Chartres. The result, Mont St. Michel and Chartres, was published privately in 1904 and again (in a slightly revised form) in 1912. Chartres came out as a trade edition published by the American Institute of Architects in 1913--and broke sales records. A stroke in 1913 ended Adams's travels, but he resumed the political salon in his Washington home. He died in 1918, shortly before the publication of his autobiography The Education of Henry Adams, for which he posthumously received the Pulitzer Prize. Henry Adams is buried in Washington next to his beloved Clover.<br>Towers and Portals<br>from Mont St. Michel and Chartres<br><br>For a first visit to Chartres, choose some pleasant morning when the lights are soft, for one wants to be welcome, and the Cathedral has moods, at times severe. At best, the Beauce is a country none too gay.<br><br>The first glimpse that is caught, and the first that was meant to be caught, is that of the two spires. With all the education that Normandy and the Isle de France can give, one is still ignorant. The spire is the simplest part of the Romanesque or Gothic architecture, and needs least study in order to be felt. It is a bit of sentiment almost pure of practical purpose. It tells the whole of its story at a glance, and its story is the best that architecture had to tell, for it typified the aspirations of man at the moment when man's aspirations were highest. Yet nine persons out of ten,--perhaps ninety-nine in a hundred,--who come within sight of the two spires of Chartres will think it a jest if they are told that the smaller of the two, the simpler, the one that impresses them least, is the one which they are expected to recognise as the most perfect piece of architecture in the world. Perhaps the French critics might deny that they make any such absolute claim; in that case you can ask them what their exact claim is; it will always be high enough to astonish the tourist.<br><br>Astonished or not, we have got to take this southern spire of the Chartres Cathedral as the object of serious study, and before taking it as art, must take it as history. The foundations of this tower--always to be known as the old tower,--are supposed to have been laid in 1091, before the first crusade. The fl�che was probably half a century later (1145-1170). The foundations of the new tower, opposite, were laid not before 1110, when also the Portal, which stands between them, was begun with the three lancet windows above it, but not the Rose. For convenience, this old fa�ade, including the Portal and the two towers, but not the fl�ches, and the three lancet windows, but not the Rose, may be dated as complete about 1150.<br><br>Originally the whole Portal,--the three doors and the three lancets--stood nearly forty feet back, on the line of the interior foundation, or rear wall of the towers. This arrangement threw the towers forward, free on three sides, as at Poitiers, and gave room for a Parvis, before the Portal,--a Porch, roofed over, to protect the pilgrims who always stopped there to pray before entering the church. When the church was rebuilt after the great fire of 1194, and the architect was required to enlarge the interior, the old Portal and lancets were moved bodily forward, to be flush with the front walls of the two towers, as you see the fa�ade today; and the fa�ade itself was heightened, to give room for the Rose, and to cover the loftier pignon and vaulting behind. Finally, the wooden roof, above the stone vault, was masked by the Arcade of Kings and its railing, completed in the taste of Philip the Hardy, who reigned from 1270 to 1285.<br><br>These changes have of course altered the values of all the parts. The Portal is injured by being thrown into a glare of light, when it was intended to stand in shadow, as you will see in the north and south Porches over the transept-portals. The towers are hurt by losing relief and shadow; but the old fl�che is obliged to suffer the cruelest wrong of all by having its right shoulder hunched up by half of a huge Rose and the whole of a row of kings, when it was built to stand free, and to soar above the whole fa�ade from the top of its second storey. One can easily figure it so, and replace the lost parts of the old fa�ade, more or less at haphazard, from the front of Noyon.<br><br>What an outrage it was, you can see by a single glance at the new fl�che opposite. The architect of 1500 has flatly refused to submit to such conditions, and has insisted, with very proper self-respect, on starting from the balustrade of the arcade of kings, as his level. Not even content with that, he has carried up his square tower another lofty storey before he would consent to touch the heart of his problem, the conversion of the square tower into the octagon fl�che. In doing this, he has sacrificed once more the old fl�che; but his own tower stands free as it should.<br><br>At Vendome, when you go there, you will be in a way to appreciate still better what happened to the Chartres fl�che; for the clocher at Vendome, which is of the same date,--Viollet-le-Duc says earlier, and Enlart, "after 1130,"--stood, and still stands, free, like an Italian campanile, which gives it a vast advantage. The tower of St. Leu d'Esserent, also after 1130, stands free, above the second storey. Indeed, you will hardly find, in the long list of famous French spires, another which has been treated with so much indignity as this, the greatest and most famous of all; and perhaps the most annoying part of it is that you must be grateful to the architect of 1195 for doing no worse. He has on the contrary, done his best to show respect for the work of his predecessor, and has done so well that, handicapped as it is, the old tower still defies rivalry. Nearly three hundred and fifty feet high, or, to be exact, 106.50 metres from the church floor, it is built up with an amount of intelligence and refinement that leaves to unprofessional visitors no chance to think a criticism,--much less to express one. Perhaps--when we have seen more--and feel less--who knows? but certainly not now!<br><br>"The greatest, and surely the most beautiful monument of this kind that we possess in France," says Viollet-le-Duc; but although an ignorant spectator must accept the architect's decision on a point of relative merit, no one is compelled to accept his reasons as final. "There is no need to dwell," he continues, "upon the beauty and the grandeur of composition in which the artist has given proof of rare sobriety where all the effects are obtained not by ornaments but by the just and skilful proportion of the different parts. The transition, so hard to adjust, between the square base and the octagon of the fl�che, is managed and carried out with an address which has not been surpassed in similar monuments."<br><br>One stumbles a little at the word "adresse." One never caught oneself using the word in Norman churches. Your photographs of Bayeux or Boscherville or Secqueville will show you at a glance whether the term "adresse" applies to them. Even Vendome would rather be praised for "droiture" than for "adresse." Whether the word address means cleverness, dexterity, adroitness, or simple technical skill, the thing itself is something which the French have always admired more than the Normans ever did. Viollet-le-Duc himself seems to be a little uncertain whether to lay most stress on the one or the other quality:--<br><br>"If one tries to appreciate the conception of this tower," quotes the Abb� Bulteau (II, 84.), "one will see that it is as frank as the execution is simple and skilful. Starting from the bottom, one reaches the summit of the fl�che without marked break; without anything to interrupt the general form of the building. This clocher, whose base is broad (pleine), massive and free from ornament, transforms itself, as it springs, into a sharp spire with eight faces, without its being possible to say where the massive construction ends and the light construction begins."<br><br>Granting, as one must, that this concealment of the transition is a beauty, one would still like to be quite sure that the Chartres scheme is the best. The Norman clochers being thrown out, and that at Vendome being admittedly simple, the clocher de Saint Jean on the church of Saint Germain at Auxerre seems to be thought among the next in importance, although it is only about one hundred and sixty feet in height (49 metres), and therefore hardly in the same class with Chartres. Any photograph shows that the Auxerre spire is also simple; and that at Etampes you have seen already to be of the Vendome rather than of the Chartres type. The clocher at Senlis is more "habile"; it shows an effort to be clever, and offers a standard of comparison; but the medi�val architects seem to have thought that none of them bore rivalry with Laon for technical skill. One of these professional experts, named Villard de Honnecourt, who lived between 1200 and 1250, left a note-book which you can see in the vitrines of the Biblioth�que Nationale in the Rue Richelieu, and which is the source of most that is known about the practical ideas of medi�val architects. He came to Chartres, and, standing here before the doors, where we are standing, he made a rough drawing, not of the tower but of the Rose, which was then probably new, since it must have been planned between 1195 and 1200. Apparently the tower did not impress him strongly, for he made no note of it; but on the other hand, when he went to Laon, he became vehement in praise of the cathedral tower there, which must have been then quite new: "I have been in many countries, as you can find in this book. In no place have I ever such a tower seen as that of Laon.--J'ai est� en mult de tieres, si cum vus por�s trover en cest livre. En aucun liu onques tel tor ne vi com est cele de Loon." The reason for this admiration is the same that Viollet-le-Duc gives for admiring the tower of Chartres,--the "adresse" with which the square is changed into the octagon. Not only is the tower itself changed into the fl�che without visible junction, under cover of four corner tourelles, of open work, on slender columns, which start as squares; but the tourelles also convert themselves into octagons in the very act of rising, and end in octagon fl�ches that carry up--or once carried up--the lines of profile to the central fl�ches that soared above them. Clearly this device far surpassed in cleverness the scheme of Chartres, which was comparatively heavy and structural, the weights being adjusted for their intended work, while the transformation at Laon takes place in the air, and challenges discovery in defiance of one's keenest eyesight. "Regard . . . how the tourelles pass from one disposition to another, in rising! Meditate on it!"<br><br>The fl�che of Laon is gone, but the tower and tourelles are still there to show what the architects of the thirteenth century thought their most brilliant achievement. One cannot compare Chartres directly with any of its contemporary rivals, but one can at least compare the old spire with the new one which stands opposite and rises above it. Perhaps you will like the new best. Built at a time which is commonly agreed to have had the highest standard of taste, it does not encourage tourist or artist to insist on setting up standards of their own against it. Begun in 1507, it was finished in 1517. The dome of St. Peter's at Rome, over which Bramante and Rafael and Michael Angelo toiled, was building at the same time; Leonardo da Vinci was working at Amboise; Jean Bullant, Pierre Lescot, and their patron Francis the First, were beginning their architectural careers. Four hundred years, or thereabouts, separated the old spire from the new one; and four hundred more separate the new one from us. If Viollet-le-Duc, who himself built Gothic spires, had cared to compare his fl�ches at Clermont-Ferrand with the new fl�che at Chartres, he might perhaps have given us a rule where "adresse" ceases to have charm, and where detail becomes tiresome; but in the want of a schoolmaster to lay down a law of taste, you can admire the new fl�che as much as you please. Of course one sees that the lines of the new tower are not clean, like those of the old; the devices that cover the transition from the square to the octagon are rather too obvious; the proportion of the fl�che to the tower quite alters the values of the parts; a rigid classical taste might even go so far as to hint that the new tower, in comparison with the old, showed signs of a certain tendency towards a dim and distant vulgarity. There can be no harm in admitting that the new tower is a little wanting in repose for a tower whose business is to counterpoise the very classic lines of the old one; but no law compels you to insist on absolute repose in any form of art; if such a law existed, it would have to deal with Michael Angelo before it dealt with us. The new tower has many faults, but it has great beauties, as you can prove by comparing it with other late Gothic spires including those of Viollet-le-Duc. Its chief fault is to be where it is. As a companion to the crusades and to Saint Bernard, it lacks austerity. As a companion to the Virgin of Chartres, it recalls Diane de Poitiers.</p><h2>The Man Who Went Up in Smoke</h2><p>His holiday has just begun: an August spent with his family on a small island off the coast of Sweden. But when a neighbor gets a phone call, Martin Beck finds himself packed off to Budapest, where a boorish journalist has vanished without a trace. Instead of passing leisurely sun-filled days with his children, Beck must troll about in the Eastern Europe underworld for a man nobody knows, with the aid of the coolly efficient local police, who do business while soaking at the public baths--and at the risk of vanishing along with his quarry.</p><p>Maj Sj�wall and Per Wahl��, her husband and coauthor, wrote ten Martin Beck mysteries. Mr Wahl��, who died in 1975, was a reporter for several Swedish newspapers and magazines and wrote numerous radio and television plays, film scripts, short stories, and novels. Maj Sj�wall is also a poet.The room was small and shabby. There were no curtains and the view outside consisted of a gray fire wall, a few rusty armatures and a faded advertisement for margarine. The centre pane of glass in the left half of the window was gone and had been replaced by a roughly cut piece of cardboard. The wallpaper was floral, but so discolored by soot and seeing moisture that the pattern was scarcely visible. Here and there it had come away from the crumbling plaster, and in several places there had been attempts to repair it with adhesive strips and wrapping paper.There were a heating stove, six pieces of furniture and a picture in the room. In front of the stove stood a cardboard box of sashes and a dented aluminum coffee pot. The end of the bed faced the stove and the bedclothes consisted of a thick layer of old newspapers, a ragged quilt and a striped pillow. The picture was of a naked blonde standing beside a marble balustrade, and it was hanging to the right of the stove so that the person laying in the bed could see it before he fell asleep and immediately when he work up. Someone appeared to have enlarged the woman&#39;s nipples and genitals with a pencil.In the other part of the room, nearest to the window, stood a round table and two wooden chairs, of which one had lost its back. On the table were three empty vermouth bottles, a soft-drink bottle and two coffee cups, among other things. The ash tray has been turned upside down and among the cigarette butts, bottle tops and dead matches lay a few dirty sugar lumps, a small penknife with its blades open, and a piece of sausage. A third coffee cup had fallen to the floor and had broken. Face down on the worn linoleum, between the table and the bed, lay a dead body.In all probability this was the same person who had improved upon the picture and tired to med the wallpaper with strips of adhesive and wrapping paper. It was a man and he was lying with his legs close together, his elbows pressed against his ribs and his hands drawn up toward his head, as if in an effort to protect himself. The man was wearing a woolen vest and frayed trousers. On his feet were ragged woolen socks. A large sideboard had been tipped over him, obscuring his head and half the top part of his body. The third woolen socks. A large sideboard had been tipped over him, obscuring his head and half the tope part of his body. The third wooden chair had been thrown down beside the corpse. Its seat was bloodstained and on the top of the back handprints were clearly visible. The floor was covered with pieces of glass. Some of them had come from the glass doors of the sideboard, others from had come from the glass doors of the sideboard, others form a half-shattered wine bottle which had been thrown onto a heap of dirty underclothes by the wall. What was felt of the bottle was covered with a think skin of dried blood. Someone had drawn a white circle around it.Of its kind, the picture was almost perfect, taken by the best wide-angle lens the police possessed and in an artificial light that gave an etched sharpness to every detail.Martin Beck put down the photograph and magnifying glass, got up and went across the window. Outside it was full Swedish summer. And more than that. It was hot. On the grass of Kristineberg Park a couple of girls were sunbathing in bikinis. They were lying flat on their backs with their legs apart and their arms stretched outward away from their bodies. They were young and thin, or slim as they say, and they could do this with a certain grace. When he focused sharply, he even recognized them as two office girls from his own department. So it was already past twelve. In the morning they put on their bathing suits, cotton dresses and sandals and went to work. In the lunch hour they tool off their dresses and went out and lay in the park. Practical.Dejectedly, he recalled that soon he would have to leave all this and move over to the south police headquarters in the rowdy neighborhood around Vastberga AlleBehind him he heard someone fling open the door and come into the room. He did not need to turn around to know who it was. Stenstrom. Stenstrom was still the youngest in the department and after him there would presumably be a whole generation of detectives who did not knock on doors.&#34;How&#39;s it going?&#34; he said.&#34;Not so well,&#34; said Stenstrom When I was there fifteen minutes ago he was still flatly denying everything.&#34;Martin Beck turned around, went back to his desk and once again looked at the photo of the scene of the crime. On the ceiling above the newspaper mattress, the ragged quilt and the striped pillow, there was an old patch of dampness. It looked like a sea horse. He wondered if the man on the floor had had that much imagination.&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; said Stenstrom officiously. &#34;We&#39;ll get him on the technical evidence.&#34;Martin Beck made no reply. Instead he pointed ad the thick report Stenstrom had put down on his desk and said, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;Martin Beck took the photograph and went up one flight of stairs, opened a door and found himself with Kollberg and Melander.It was much warned in there than in his room, presumably because the windows were closed and the curtains drawn. Kollberg and the suspect were sitting opposite each other at the table, quite still. Melander, a tall man, was standing by the window, his pipe in his mouth and his arms folded. He was looking steadily at the suspect. On a chair by the door sat a police guard in uniform trousers and a light-blue shirt. He was balancing his cap on his right knee. No one said anything and the only moving thing was the reel of the tape recorder. Martin Beck situated himself to one side and just behind Kollberg and jointed in the general silence. A wasp could be heard bouncing against the window behind curtains. Kollberg had taken off his jacket and unbuttoned his shirt, but even so, his shirt was soaked with sweat between his plump shoulder blades. The wet patch slowly changed shape and spread downward in a line along his spine.The man on the other side of the table was small, with thinning hair. He was slovenly dressed and the fingers gripping the arms of his chair were uncared-for, with bitten, dirty nails. His face was thin and sickly, with weak evasive lines around his mouth. His chin was trembling slightly and his eyes seemed cloudy and watery. The man hunched up and two tears fell down his cheeks.&#34;Uh-huh,&#34; said Kollberg gloomily. &#34;You hit him on the head with the bottle, them, until it broke?&#34;The man nodded.&#34;Then you went on hitting him with the chair as he lay on the floor. How many times?&#34;&#34;Don&#39;t know. Not many. Quite a lot through.&#34;&#34;I can imagine. And then you tipped the sideboard over him and left the room. What did the third one of you do in the meantime? This Ragnar Larsson? Didn&#39;t he try to interfere; I mean, stop you?&#39;&#34;No, he didn&#39;t to anything. He just let it go on.&#34;&#34;Don&#39;t start lying again now.&#34;&#34;He was asleep. He&#39;d passed out.&#34;&#34;Try to speak a little louder, all right?&#34;&#34;He was lying on the bed, asleep. He didn&#39;t notice anything.&#34;&#34;No, not until he came to and then he went to the police.Well, so far it&#39;s clear. But there&#39;s one thing I still don&#39;t really understood. Why did it turn out this way? You&#39;d never even seen each other before you met in that beer hall.&#34;&#34;He called me a damned nazi.&#34;&#34;Every policeman gets called a damaged nazi several times a week. Hundreds of people have called me a nazi and Gestapo man and even worse things, but I&#39;ve never killed anyone for it.&#34;&#34;He sat there and said it over and over again, damned nazi, damned nazi, damned nazi. . . It was the only thing he said And he sang.&#39;&#34;Sang?&#34;&#34;Yes, to get my goat. Annoy me. About Hitler.&#34;&#34;Uh-huh. Well, had given him any cause to talk like that?&#34;&#34;I&#39;d told him my old lady was German. That was before.&#34;&#34;Before you began drinking?&#34;&#34;Yes. Then he just said it didn&#39;t matter what kind of mother a guy had.&#34;&#34;And when he was about to go out into the kitchen, you took the bottle and hit him from behind?&#34;&#34;Yes&#34;&#34;Did he fall?&#34;&#34;He sort of fell to his knees. And began bleeding. And then he said, &#39;You bloody little nazi runt, you, now you&#39;re in for it.&#39; &#34;&#34;And so you went on hitting him?&#34;&#34;I was . . . afraid. He was bigger than me and. . . you don&#39;t know what it feels like. . . everything just goes round and round and goes red . . . I didn&#39;t seem to know what I was doing.&#34;The man&#39;s shoulders were shaking violently.&#34;That&#39;s enough,&#34; said Kollberg, switching off the tape recorder. &#34;Give him something to eat and ask the doctor if the can have a sedative.&#34;The policeman by the door rose, put his cap on and led the murdered out, holding him loosely by the arm.&#34;Bye for now. See you tomorrow,&#34; said Kollbergy absently.At the same time he was writing mechanically on the paper in front of him, &#34;Confessed in tears.&#34;&#34;Quite a character,&#34; he said.&#34;Five previous convictions for assault,&#34; said Melander. &#34;In spite of his denying it every time. I remember him very well.&#34;&#34;Said the walking card file,&#34; Kollberg commented.He rose heavily and started at martin Beck.&#34;What are you doing here?&#39; he said. &#34;Go take your holiday and let us look after the criminal ways of the lower classes. Where are you going, but the way? To the islands?&#34;Martin Beck nodded.&#34;Smart,&#34; said Kollberg. &#34;I went to Rumania first and got firend-in Mamaia. Then I come home and get boiled. Great.And you don&#39;t have any telephone out there?&#34;&#34;No.&#34;&#34;Excellent. I&#39;m going to take a shower now anyhow. Come on. Run along now.&#34;Martin Beck thought it over. The suggestion had its advantages. Among other things, he would get away a day earlier. He shrugged his shoulders.&#34;I&#39;m leaving. Bye, boys. See you in a month.&#34;Most people&#39;s holidays were already over and Stockholm&#39;s August-hot streets had begun to fill with people who ha spent a...</p><h2>How to Grow a Novel: The Most Common Mistakes Writers Make and How to Overcome Them</h2><p>Each year thousands of fiction writers, from beginners to bestselling author, benefit from Sol Stein's sold-out workshops, featured appearances at writers' conferences, software for writers, on-line columns, and his popular first book for writers, <i>Stein on Writing</i>. Stein practices what he teaches: He is the author of nine novels, including the million-copy bestseller <i>The Magician</i>, as well as editor of such major writers as James Baldwin, Jack Higgins, Elia Kazan, Budd Schulberg, W. H. Auden, and Jacques Barzun, and the teacher and editor of several current bestselling authors. What sets Stein apart is his practical approach. He provides specific techniques that speed writers to successful publication.<br><br><i>How to Grow a Novel </i>is not just a book, but an invaluable workshop in print. It includes details and examples from Stein's editorial work with a #1 bestselling novelist as well as talented newcomers. Stein takes the reader backstage in the development of memorable characters and fascinating plots. The chapter on dialogue overflows with solutions for short-story writers, novelists, screenwriters, and playwrights. Stein shows what readers are looking for-- and what they avoid-- in the experience of reading fiction. The book offers guidelines-- and warnings-- of special value for nonfiction writers who want to move into fiction. Stein points to the little, often overlooked things that damage the writer's authority without the writer knowing it. And this book, like no other writing book, takes the reader behind the scenes of the publishing business as it affects writers of every level of experience, revealing the hard truths that are kept behind shut doors.<br></p><p>Sol Stein likens the reader of fiction to a baseball fan. The "tension, suspense, anxiety, and pleasure" a spectator experiences are "all the things readers hope for when they turn to a novel." In <i>How to Grow a Novel</i>, Stein coaches fiction writers in providing exactly those things for readers. First off, says Stein, you must write what you read; don't try to pull off a romance novel if you are a student of serious literature, or a literary masterpiece if you thrive on thrillers. With that in mind, Stein gears his book toward both "those who are trying to write a good book and those who are trying to write a good read." Most of <i>How to Grow a Novel</i> delineates what Stein considers to be a writer's obligations to his readers. A writer, he says, should be "amusing, entertaining, interesting," should create characters with character, and should maintain interest primarily by "never tak[ing] the reader where the reader wants to go." Stein illustrates his points with examples from his own experiences as a novelist and as a fiction editor.<p> The final section of the book is devoted to the responsibilities of the publisher. Any but the most stalwart writer can't help but be disheartened by the book business. It has often been said that a publisher determines a book's fate--barring a miracle--long before it is even released, by the funds allocated to publicize it. Stein takes this one step further, positing that a book's positioning is determined "when the agent submits it for consideration.... There are reportedly nearly a thousand literary agents in North American alone, but fewer than a dozen have clout."</p><p> Still, take heart, and try to enjoy the process. "Writing is the second most exciting activity a higher power invented for human beings," says Stein. "And when you get to your eighties, it's the first most exciting activity." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>In 1999, a distinguished panel convened by the Modern Library published a list of the 100 best nonfiction works of the century. Two books edited by Sol Stein were in the top half of that list. Stein was in his twenties when his play <i>Napoleon</i> won the Dramatists Alliance award as "the best full-length play of 1953." He is the author of nine novels, which have made bestseller lists as far away as Moscow. He is also an anthologized poet, the author of nonfiction books, screenplays, and TV dramas, and the creator of the award-winning computer software WritePro�, as well as FirstAid for Writers� and FictionMaster�. Webster Schott, writing in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, said of Stein's novel <i>The Magician</i>, "Beautiful and gripping. I cannot recall a novel of this type with greater pleasure." On another occasion, the <i>Times</i> said, "If you bury yourself in a Sol Stein book while walking, you'll walk into a wall."<br><br>Stein has lectured on creative writing at Columbia, Iowa, UCLA, and the University of California at Irvine, which presented him with the Distinguished Instructor Award in 1993. His on-line columns appear on America Online, the Writers Club on the World Wide Web, and elsewhere on the Internet.<br></p><h2>Hand-Feeding and Raising Baby Birds: Breeding, Hand-Feeding, Care, and Management</h2><p>This book is for both amateur bird owners and professional breeders. It offers instructions on maintaining a bird nursery, keeping it heated and sanitary, and tending the chicks. Differing feed formulas are given for different species, including parrots, doves, finches, soft-billed birds, pheasants, and others. Advice pertains to correcting problems often suffered by baby birds, from dehydration and discolored feathers to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections.</p><p></p><h2>Scales of Justice</h2><p>The savage beating death of a nobleman transforms a quiet, pastoral English village into a danger zone, and Inspector Alleyn must catch the killer before he strikes again. Reissue.</p><p><p>Ngaio Marsh is the author of numerous crime novels. Along with Agatha Christie, Margery Allingham, and Dorothy L. Sayers, she was classed as one of the four original "Queens of Crime"&nbsp;of&nbsp;the 1920s and 1930s. Benedict Cumberbatch is an actor whose movies include <i>Atonement </i>and <i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i>.</p>Listening to SCALES OF JUSTICE is like taking a trip back to mid-twentieth-century rural England. The classes know their place, eccentricities abound, the district nurse is named Kettle, and the story has a featured cat. No accent, implication, or physical description escapes narrator Peter Wickham&#39;s sparkling presentation. When one of the local villagers is murdered, everyone is suspect. The indomitable Roderic Alleyn and his sidekick, Fox, wade through clues and fish scales (note the title) to find the culprit. The best part is an endearing romance that&#39;s totally unexpected. The vintage style of story and presentation make this a perfect audiobook. Like the works of Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, Marsh&#39;s classic mysteries will live forever.

The book features an Introduction by Gloria Steinem. </p><p>The book is a conversation with 19 prominent women artists, lawyers, ranchers, doctors, educators and activists. They share their unique--and surprisingly candid--perspectives on ceremony, the importance of context, Native American governance, womanhood, love and acceptance, and the value of traditional knowledge and institutions. </p><p>Says Steinem in her Introduction, "Wilma Mankiller has brought together wise voices in a conversation about the things for which we long the most," including Community, Balance, Peaceful Ways of Resolving Differences and Being of Good Mind. </p><p>Mankiller sees Every Day is a Good Day as an affirmation of the important role women with traditional knowledge have played in the political and cultural survival of Native people. "Our unique tribal worldview has enabled our culture and governments to endure war, relocation, loss of land and lives," she says. "And it is that worldview that has allowed me to remain positive even as I have dealt with two kidney transplants and two bouts of cancer." </p><p>The conversations were held in separate places, from Onondaga Territory in New York to Hawaii, but are presented as a larger discussion to evoke a sense of a gathering. "They find many moments of grace, beauty, and joy in their busy lives," says Mankiller. "And despite everything, they tend to view economic poverty as a barrier and a challenge, not a state of being." </p><p>"I hope that EVERY DAY IS A GOOD DAY will help people from many different communities learn about the special world in which these women live and see how they conduct their lives with dignity, faith, hope, and optimism," says Mankiller.</p>Wilma Mankiller: Wilma Mankiller was an author, activist, and former principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. Her roots were planted deep in the rural community Mankiller Flats in Adair County, Oklahoma, where she spent most of her life. She has been honored with many awards, including the Presidental Medal of Freedom, and has received honorary degrees from such esteemed institutions as Yale University, Dartmouth College, and Smith College.

But that is what you get when your nephew hangs out at water parks and speaks cetacean&#x2013;a.k.a. dolphin. By morning, a person is dead and Steve has a new client: none other than one of the animal liberators. There&#x2019;s just one loophole: Victoria is on the case too&#x2014;on the opposite side.<br><br>No wonder Larry King says that this is &#x201c;mystery writing at its very best&#x201d; and Dave Barry says Paul Levine writes a terrific courtroom drama that&#x2019;s also funny as hell!&#x201d;</p><p>Paul Levine is a former trial lawyer and the award-winning author of the Solomon vs. Lord legal thrillers.&nbsp; He has also written for the CBS television program, <i>JAG.&nbsp; </i> Levine lives in Los Angeles, where he is working on his next Jimmy Payne thriller.&nbsp;<i>Chapter One<br><br>Runing Tall</i><br> Just after two a.m., Steve Solomon sprinted along the seawall, chasing the man on the Jet Ski. Black wet suit. Black helmet. Dark visor. A Darth Vader look.<br><br>The man shot Steve the bird, then shoved the throttle wide open. The Jet Ski jolted airborne, splashed down, and roared along the channel toward Biscayne Bay.<br><br>"Stop him, Uncle Steve!"<br><br>Bobby, urging him on. Steve had ordered his twelve-year-old nephew to stay on the dock, but the boy was running, too, trailing behind.<br><br>"You can catch him!"<br><br>Sure, kiddo. Leave it to me to capture the bad guy, rescue the dolphins, save the world.<br><br>A quarter-moon hung like a scythe over the Bay. Cetacean Park should have been quiet. The channel should have rippled placidly in the moist breeze, the air scented with salt and seaweed. Instead, the Jet Ski growled like an angry beast, belching greasy vapors in its wake.<br><br>Steve picked up his pace. Years earlier, he had been the fastest Jewish kid on Pine Tree Drive, admittedly a group with more shleppers than sprinters.<br><br>He figured there was one chance to catch the man. The channel ran straight for three hundred yards, then dog-legged right for another two hundred yards before reaching open water. He could cut diagonally across an empty field, the shortest leg of the triangle, and intercept the Jet Ski at the inlet to the Bay.<br><br>Steve looked back over his shoulder. Bobby had stopped along the seawall, either because he was pooped or because he was belatedly following his uncle's orders.<br><br>Steve ran tall, back straight, shoulders relaxed, head still. He had always been fast over short distances. Stealing bases at U of M, a painless ninety-foot sprint. But lousy at distance running. No patience for the training, no tolerance for the pain. Before Victoria, his live-in girlfriend, he'd been a sprinter in his personal life, too. Hundred-yard dashes, hundred-hour relationships.<br><br>Flying now, feet barely touching the ground. Hopped over a fallen pond frond, never breaking stride. Shot a look at the Jet Skier, the dive knife sheathed at his ankle. Calculated time and distance. And possible injuries.<br><br>Knife wound, concussion, drowning.<br><br>They would reach the intersection of channel and Bay simultaneously.<br><br>Steve hit the embankment and drove off his back foot. He launched into space, arms spread like wings, soaring toward the man on the Jet Ski, thinking . . .<br><br>Just what the hell am I doing?<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br><br>From Bedroom to Bay</i><br>One hour before leaping into the darkness of Biscayne Bay, Steve was locked in the spooning position with his girlfriend and law partner, Victoria Lord, her hair tickling his nose, her sweet scent fueling his dreams. The phone jarred him awake. Wade Grisby at Cetacean Park.<br><br>Victoria stirred as Steve pulled on his Hurricanes running shorts and a T-shirt with the slogan: "What If the Hokey Pokey Is What It's All About?"<br><br>"Bobby," Steve whispered. Explanation enough.<br><br>She rolled over, her blond hair splayed across the pillow. "Dolphins or stars?"<br><br>Steve understood the shorthand. Bobby had broken into the planetarium the night of a meteor shower. Lately, the kid had been sneaking out of the house to play with the dolphins on Key Biscayne.<br><br>He stroked Victoria's cheek. "Dolphins. Wade Grisby caught him talking to Spunky and Misty."<br><br>Talking and listening. Bobby believed he could understand dolphinese, as he called it. The boy was even writing a dictionary of the clicks, whistles, and moans that came from their blowholes.<br><br>Victoria propped up on one elbow. In her sheer black negligee, with her sleepy eyes, she looked like a star in one of the old black-and-white movies. Lauren Bacall, about to entice her man back to bed.<br><br>"Steve, I just can't get enough of you."<br><br>Instead, Victoria said, "Steve, maybe it's time Bobby saw a therapist."<br><br>"I'll talk to him. He'll be okay."<br><br>Steve leaned over and kissed her, Victoria exhaling a warm breath. Asleep before he was out the door.<br><br>Every day another drama, Steve thought, driving across the Rickenbacker Causeway. Getting Bobby out of another jam. This didn't sound as serious as climbing on a catwalk over I-95 to spray paint an exit sign. Bobby had removed the apostrophe from the word "Beaches' " because the typographical error drove him nuts. The kid was sweet and loveable, and in some mysterious way, a genius. But he wasn't socially developed, and lately he'd been acting out.<br><br>Breaking curfew. Trespassing. Keeping secrets.<br><br>Steve had asked Bobby if everything was okay, if he was having problems, if he wanted to talk about anything.<br><br>"Yep."<br><br>"Nope."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Typical adolescent. But unusual for a kid who was ordinarily so verbal. Steve wondered if Bobby's central nervous system disorders were in play. A little klutzy, a lot brainy. The kid seesawed between semi-autistic behavior and savantlike abilities of memory and language feats. "Paradoxical functional facilitation," the doctors called it. Bobby could create anagrams in his head. But lately, his wordplay had been limited to chirping sounds at the breakfast table. Dolphinese.<br><br>Steve pulled his Mustang convertible into the empty lot at the bayside attraction. Signs pointed toward the bottlenose dolphin channel, the killer whale tank, the indoor aquarium.<br><br>Steve hustled toward the channel. Wondering if he'd been too lax with Bobby, too reluctant to discipline him. Grounding his nephew didn't seem to work. The kid just crawled out his bedroom window and took off.<br><br>Steve followed a path of palm trees to the channel. Spotlights on metal poles illuminated the dark water. He figured Grisby would be in his small dockside office, lecturing Bobby on the dangers of breaking into other people's businesses.<br><br>That's when Steve heard the roar of the engine. Spotted Darth Vader. Totally surreal.<br><br>The Jet Ski carved a turn, kicked up spray, and slowed near the dock. The rider glared at Steve. Early twenties with a pugnacious jaw and cruel mouth. Raising a fist above his head, he shouted, "Liberation!"<br><br>What the hell's going on? Where's Grisby? Where's Bobby?<br><br>"Bobby!"<br><br>Steve heard sneakered footsteps on the concrete dock, his nephew running toward him, all flying elbows and knees, a skinny arm pointing at the masked man on the Jet Ski. "He's stealing Spunky and Misty!"<br><br>The man cruised close to the seawall and bared his teeth. "Freedom for the animals!"<br><br>So that's it. The guy's a dolphin-kidnapping, animal-libbing, eco-terrorist asshole.<br><br>Steve was all for animal rights. But not burning down labs. Or bombing research centers. Or terrorizing scientists. If a few rats had to die to find a cure for cancer--well, it was a trade-off that made sense.<br><br>The man gave Steve the finger, gunned the Jet Ski, and headed out the channel toward the Bay.<br><br>"Stop him, Uncle Steve!"<br><br><i>Chapter Three<br><br>Call Me Fishmeal<br><br></i><br>One hour before Bobby Solomon begged his uncle to stop Darth Vader from stealing the two dolphins, the boy had climbed a chain-link fence, sneaked across a concrete dock, and crept over a catwalk to a floating wooden platform.<br><br>Praying he wouldn't be caught.<br><br>Uncle Steve would be so pissed. But Bobby had decided to take the risk.<br><br>I need to talk to Misty and Spunky.<br><br>His best friends.<br><br>Waiting for their signal, Bobby sprawled on his back. He let his eyes grow accustomed to the dark. In a moment, he spotted the constellation Sagittarius in the clear night sky.<br><br>A splash, then a rapid-fire click-creak-click. A second splash and a familiar high-pitched whistle.<br><br>Misty and Spunky saying hello.<br><br>They were the stars at Cetacean Park. Spunky was the color of a blue-steel revolver, with a long beak and a gray belly. His fluke--the wing-shaped paddle at the end of his tail--was oversize, powering his giant leaps. He weighed about 250 pounds, depending on how much mackerel he'd had for breakfast. Misty, his girlfriend, had a sleek, silvery-blue body with a pink belly. She loved to be rubbed at the base of her dorsal fin.<br><br>Bobby put two fingers to his lips and whistled. Two short blasts. "Hi guys."<br><br>Spunky slapped the water with a fin, splashing Bobby. The Spunkster joking around.<br><br>No tanks to confine them, the two dolphins lived in a channel that ran to Biscayne Bay, a steel gate blocking their path to open water. Bobby swam with the dolphins, fed them, played with them. Even watched them have sex, belly-to-belly.<br><br>Not an everyday sighting. Not like seeing Pamela Anderson or Paris Hilton do the big nasty on video.<br>Pennants strung across the channel crackled in the sea breeze. The park had been closed for hours, but sugary songs about a thousand years old still poured from the speakers. Barbra Streisand was ordering someone not to rain on her parade. Barbra Streisand. SAD BREAST BRAIN.<br><br>So easy. You just picture the letters, and they fly around and anagrammatize themselves. Bobby thought in pictures and sounds, just like the dolphins. He could remember almost everything he'd ever seen or heard.<br><br>For the past year, he'd been listening to the sounds coming from Spunky's and Misty's blowholes, trying to untangle their language. Building a dictionary of dolphin talk. The clicks and squeaks, moans and whistles all meant something, but you had to be patient. You had to really listen and remember the patterns. Tonight, he hoped to add a few new phrases to his notebook. Then he'd bicycle home, sneak back into the house without waking Uncle Steve and Victoria, and catch some z's before school.<br><br>Earlier tonight, he'd told Victoria a big fat fib. More than one, really. She'd been cooking meat loaf, filled with onions and dripping with Worcestershire an...</p><h2>Fathering Your School-Age Child: A Dad&#39;s Guide to the Wonder Years</h2><p><b>A practical handbook on all aspects of fatherhood during the third to the ninth year (pre-K through the fourth grade) by the best-selling, critically acclaimed author of <i>The Expectant Father.</i> </b> <br> <br>Following the success of the three previous volumes in this series&#x2014;<i>The Expectant Father, The New Father: A Dad's Guide to the First Year</i> and <i>Fathering Your Toddler</i>&#x2014;this book is similarly packed with facts, tips, and advice on all aspects of fatherhood.

Over the course of this year, your three-year-old will grow just two or three inches and put on only five or six pounds. By the time he turns four, he&#x2019;ll have a full set of baby teeth.<br> <br>By now, your child will be getting an uninterrupted 10-12 hours of sleep at night, except, of course, those nights when you&#x2019;ve planned a romantic evening at home. He often wakes up dry, but accidents are still common. By the end of this year, a lot of girls will be toilet-trained. Boys usually take a little longer to get completely out of diapers, but they&#x2019;re on their way too.<br> <br>He walks and runs like a champ usually without having to hold his arms out for balance. In fact, he&#x2019;s so good that he can even take corners at full speed. Once he does slow down, you might catch him practicing walking on tiptoe.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s a good climber and runner, and should be able to jump up and down, as well as hop on one leg. He can kick a ball forward, catch one if it lands on his outstretched arms, and walk up (but not down) stairs alternating feet.<br> <br>And how &#x2019;bout those fine motor skills. Somebody&#x2019;s feeding himself with a spoon, and most of the food is actually getting inside. He brushes his teeth, holds a crayon sort of like we do, traces some (very basic) shapes, and may even take a crack at drawing people most of whom will bear an uncanny resemblance to Mr. Potato Head. He can build a tower nine or ten blocks high; he&#x2019;s figured out how to screw open jars and bottles (although he has no interest in closing them), and how to turn the pages of a book one at a time.<br> <br>Sometime around the middle of this year, your child may backslide a little physically. He&#x2019;ll fall down and bump into things more often than he did a few months ago, and those block towers won&#x2019;t be nearly as steady or as high as they were. Not to worry, this will pass as he nears his fourth birthday.<br> <br>Intellectually<br>Your child will not stop talking, and you can understand about three-quarters of what he says. He&#x2019;s got an active vocabulary of over 600 words and likes to arrange them in three-to-five-word sentences.<br> <br>Even with the nonstop chatter, he&#x2019;s still not much of a conversationalist and prefers announcements and demands to give and take.<br> <br>He loves stories and rhymes, preferably over and over and over and over. The good news is that if you get laryngitis, he&#x2019;s perfectly able to read&#x201d; you the book in his own words, using the pictures as a guide.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s got now,&#x201d; soon,&#x201d; and in a minute&#x201d; down pretty well, but he&#x2019;s a little fuzzy on more abstract time words such as tomorrow,&#x201d; yesterday,&#x201d; and today.&#x201d; He also understands simple sequences much better than before and can handle two or three steps in a row: we went to the park, then we came home, and then we watched a video.<br> <br>He associates people with places, which means he may not recognize his favorite pediatrician if you bump into him in line at the grocery store.<br> <br>He can identify the primary colors and maybe a few others, and counts one, two, a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>He can put together six-piece puzzles and loves the relationship between whole objects and the parts that make them up. But he thinks like Yogi Berra, the famous New York Yankees catcher. When ordering a pizza, Berra was asked how many pieces he wanted it cut into. He replied, You better cut it into four pieces, because I&#x2019;m not hungry enough to eat six.&#x201d; If you pour a cup of water into a bowl, and another cup into a tall glass, your child will insist that the glass has more in it. And if you cut one cookie in half and another into four pieces, he&#x2019;ll take the one with four pieces every time.<br> <br>His imagination is soaring, and his active fantasy life includes dress-up and role-playing. Cross-dressing is still common at this age, as are imaginary friends. These characters serve a very important purpose, helping him try out different behaviors and emotions, and giving him someone to blame if things don&#x2019;t work.<br> <br>Emotionally/Socially<br>Whew, those terrible twos are pretty much over. There&#x2019;s a good chance that your three-year-old will do what you ask him to the first or second time instead of the seventeenth or twenty-ninth. He says yes more often than no, and, craving your approval, he&#x2019;s ready and eager to help you with household chores. When he does ignore you or misbehave, he may express some guilt or embarrassment later.<br> <br>But about halfway through this year, your compliant, cooperative, cheerful little angel may become possessed. He&#x2019;ll be obstinate, ornery, insecure, anxious, and will completely refuse to go along with anything you ask. Fortunately, there&#x2019;s no need to call in an exorcist, as this phase will begin to fade by the end of this year.<br> <br>He may also spend some time testing your limits, pushing you just to see what kind of reaction he&#x2019;ll get. Luckily, he&#x2019;s got a fairly short attention span, and you can easily distract him, which makes it easier to avoid a crisis.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s becoming a little less self-centered, changing from I want&#x201d; demands to Let&#x2019;s do&#x201d; requests.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s becoming very aware of differences in race and gender, and understands that certain activities are boy&#x201d; things and others are girl&#x201d; things. Most of the kids he plays with will be of the same sex. Interestingly, though, he may start expressing a preference for the opposite-sex parent.<br> <br>He enjoys playing near other children his own age, but not necessarily with them. And although he&#x2019;ll occasionally give one of his toys to another child, he&#x2019;s still a ways away from mastering the fine art of sharing.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s discovered the joy of making other people laugh, and can be quite silly at times.<br> <br>He is learning that other people are real and have real feelings. The tiny seeds of compassion have begun to sprout, and on occasion, he may comfort you if you hurt yourself.<br> <br> <b>What&#x2019;s Going On with You</b> <br> <br>Experiencing More Empathy<br>Over the past decade, I&#x2019;ve interviewed several thousand fathers. And one theme that comes up again and again is that fatherhood seems to open all sorts of emotional doors. Many men say that after having children, they were all of a sudden able (or forced) to experience feelings they didn&#x2019;t even know they were capable of, everything from joy and pride and intense love to blinding fury, disgust, and jealousy. And there was one more feeling, which may or may not qualify as an emotion: empathy. Call it the ability to understand and imagine what other people are feeling without them having to tell you.<br> <br>During the preschool and early school years, most children can&#x2019;t really express their emotions verbally as well as they&#x2019;d like to, which makes it hard for parents to understand what&#x2019;s going on inside their kids&#x2019; hearts and minds. Fortunately, you have some conscious or subconscious memories of what you felt like when you were a kid, and that makes it possible for you to empathize with your child at least a little bit. For example, if your child is still wetting his bed at night or having accidents during the day, you may be reminded of the shame you felt when you did the same thing at the same age. That kind of empathy can make you a lot more tolerant and patient not only of your child but of others as well. To be able to feel what the child feels enlarges the parents&#x2019; capacity for empathy in other interpersonal relationships,&#x201d; writes the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry. Doctors who are parents, for example, are better able to empathize with their patients, which is something a lot of parents instinctively feel. Think about when you take your child to the pediatrician. You probably never asked whether he has kids of his own, but don&#x2019;t you really want to know? This isn&#x2019;t to say that childless people shouldn&#x2019;t be allowed to be pediatricians or that pediatricians who have kids are naturally better. That&#x2019;s not true at all. What is true, though, is that as we become more empathetic with our children, we naturally want people to be more empathetic with us. (I actually know a pediatric emergency medicine doctor who had to change specialties after becoming a father. He simply couldn&#x2019;t deal emotionally with all the injured children.)<br> <br>As your child gets older and his vocabulary increases, he&#x2019;ll begin using words to express many of his innermost feelings. To be truly empathetic, you need to really listen to him not just to the words, but to the emotions behind them. Connecting with your child on that kind of level leads to a far deeper kind of empathy than you experienced before again, toward both your child and others.<br> <br>Confronting Your Demons and Putting Them to Work for You<br>Like it or not, who you are as a dad right now has a lot to do with the kind of childhood you had. To brew up an adult,&#x201d; wrote psychologist Roger Gould, it seems that some leftover childhood must be mixed in; a little unfinished business from the past periodically intrudes on our adult life, confusing our relationships and disturbing our sense of self.&#x201d;<br> <br>But your own often-zany childhood doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to have a negative impact on your fathering. In fact, for most men, it&#x2019;s just the opposite. Most fathers try hard to give their children the positive things they experienced during their own childhood, to spare their children the pain they themselves suffered, and to make sure their children never lack what they did.<br> <br>Harvard researcher John Snarey found that that men with positive memories of being fathered use their fathers as models. In other words, if a boy&#x2019;s father gave him a good education, was warm and nurturing, and supported his emotional and physical growth, he tends to do the same with his own kids when he becomes a father himself. At the same time, when men have negative memories of their fathers (for example, their dads didn&#x2019;t provide a good education or a stable economic situation, or relied too much on physical punishment), they tend to use their father&#x2019;s shortcomings as an example of exactly what not to do and as motivation to do better.<br> <br>Were you an only child? If you loved being one, you might want only one kid. If you hated it, you might want to have a large family. Similarly, if you&#x2019;re one of nine kids and were continually getting lost in the shuffle, you might want a small family. If your brothers and sisters put together a championship baseball team, you might want to have nine or ten kids of your own. If you never graduated from high school, you might do everything you can do to ensure that your children get the best education possible. If you grew up in a rich family, you might want your kids to learn what it&#x2019;s like to have to earn their own money. And if you grew up in a poor family, you might want to make sure they never have to go without the things that money can buy. Ultimately, having kids isn&#x2019;t exactly a second chance to live your own life. You can, though, boost the odds that the next generation will have it better than you did.<br> <br>One big question here is whether (and if so, how much) you should talk to your children about these things. If the decision is about how large a family to have, your children probably won&#x2019;t be invited into the discussion. If the issues have to do with education or money, you may talk about them over a number of years. But what about events or experiences that were decidedly negative, or at least murky? When if ever would you tell your child that you spent time in jail, whether it was the result of a silly college prank gone wrong or something more serious? Do you tell him about a previous marriage? What about if you killed someone in a car accident? And what if something awful happened to you?<br> <br>I faced this last dilemma (and I&#x2019;m still facing it now) with regard to an experience of abuse at the hands of a trusted friend who worked at the YMCA where I spent a lot of time after school lifting weights. It happened more than thirty years ago, but I still sometimes feel a twinge of shame when I think about it. Should I tell my children? If so, when and how? Do I write my experience off as something so rare and unpredictable that there&#x2019;s no possible way to guard against it, or do I teach my children to be wary of everyone even the people they think are friends? After all, just one error in judgment could forever change or even end a life.<br> <br>At this point in your childs life, the answer is pretty black-and-white: Keep your past to yourself. Well be talking about this in great detail in the next book in this series. But for now value your childs innocence and help him stay that way.<br> <br> <b>You and Your Child</b> <br> <br>Why Be Involved with Your Three-Year-Old?<br>Simple. Because the more involved you are in raising your children, the better a father you&#x2019;ll be. Being an involved dad is good for everyone: your kids, your partner, and even yourself. Of course, what exactly being involved&#x201d; means to you will probably be different from what it means to anyone else. But however you define it, remember that it&#x2019;s a function of both quality time and quantity time. Kids whose dads are around but don&#x2019;t spend much time with them end up doing about as poorly as kids whose fathers aren&#x2019;t around at all. Here are some of the specific benefits to being actively involved with your three-year-old:<br> <br>The closer and more positive your relationship with your child, the better his friendships with his peers will be.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re helping your child separate from his mother. Healthy though dependency on their mother is for children at the beginning of their life,&#x201d; writes fatherhood researcher Kyle Pruett, they will not experience, let alone practice, their own competence and mastery skills if they do not strike off in search of their own physical and emotional autonomy.&#x201d;<br> <br>As amazing as it sounds, the quality of your relationship with your three-year-old is a good predictor of his capacity for empathy toward others when he grows up, according to researchers at McGill University in Canada.<br> <br>Your child will be more curious and a better, more confident problem-solver.Seeing you participate in child care and other home-related tasks will make your child less likely to have traditional, stereotyped ideas of what women and men are supposed to do. Your involvement at this age is also a good predictor of how involved your children especially boys will be when they become parents.<br> <br>By playing physically with your child, you&#x2019;re giving him a great way to burn off some of his aggression that might otherwise get directed at others.<br> <br>You&#x2019;ll be a more effective parent. Researcher Mary De Luccie did a study of 177 firstborn boys and girls in an attempt to figure out what made dads get involved and feel satisfied. She found that it was a kind of loop: fathers who were warm and firm with their kids felt they were doing a good job and thought they had good relationships with their kids. That, in turn, made them want to get even more involved. It just keeps getting better and better.<br> <br> <b>Education</b> <br> <br>Looking for Preschool The Pressure&#x2019;s On<br>By the time their children hit three, most parents have already started thinking about moving their child into a more formal preschool or pre-kindergarten situation. In fact, over 60 percent of children under five are in some kind of nonparental child-care situation.

It also offers an extensive and sophisticated treatment of the philosophical themes and views most central to his thinking, as well as the ideas that proved most influential to later philosophers.<br>Dating from the era when Nietzsche was at the peak of his intellectual powers, most of this book was written just before <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra,</i> and the rest of it five years later, after <i>Beyond Good and Evil.</i> Zarathustra makes his first appearance in these pages, along with the author's well-known proclamation of the death of God &#x2014; a concept to which much of the book is devoted &#x2014; and his doctrine of the eternal recurrence. Readers will find this volume a wellspring for some of Nietzsche's most sustained and thought-provoking discussions of art and morality, knowledge and truth, the intellectual conscience, and the origin of logic.</p><p>Nietzsche wrote The Gay Science, which he later described as &#39;perhaps my most personal book&#39;, when he was at the height of his intellectual powers, and the reader will find in it an extensive and sophisticated treatment of the philosophical themes and views most central to Nietzsche&#39;s own thought and most influential on later thinkers. This volume presents the work in a new translation by Josefine Nauckhoff, with an introduction by Bernard Williams that elucidates the work&#39;s main themes and discusses their continuing importance.Nietzsche called The Gay Science "the most personal of all my books." It was here that he first proclaimed the death of God -- to which a large part of the book is devoted -- and his doctrine of the eternal recurrence. <br>Walter Kaufmann's commentary, with its many quotations from previously untranslated letters, brings to life Nietzsche as a human being and illuminates his philosophy. The book contains some of Nietzsche's most sustained discussions of art and morality, knowledge and truth, the intellectual conscience and the origin of logic. <br>Most of the book was written just before Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the last part five years later, after Beyond Good and Evil. We encounter Zarathustra in these pages as well as many of Nietzsche's most interesting philosophical ideas and the largest collection of his own poetry that he himself ever published. <br>Walter Kaufmann's English versions of Nietzsche represent one of the major translation enterprises of our time. He is the first philosopher to have translated Nietzsche's major works, and never before has a single translator given us so much of Nietzsche.</p><h2>Call the Midwife: A True Story of the East End in the 1950s</h2><p>THE TABLET &#39;This uplifting story is about love, that of mothers for their children, and the love of God that compelled the nuns to dedicate their lives to the well-being of the poor.&#39; --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. Book Description Tie-in edition of Jennifer Worth&#39;s tales of being a midwife in 1950s London, now a major BBC TV series. Product Description Jennifer Worth came from a sheltered background when she became a midwife in the Docklands in the 1950s. The conditions in which many women gave birth just half a century ago were horrifying, not only because of their grimly impoverished surroundings, but also because of what they were expected to endure. But while Jennifer witnessed brutality and tragedy, she also met with amazing kindness and understanding, tempered by a great deal of Cockney humour. She also earned the confidences of some whose lives were truly stranger, more poignant and more terrifying than could ever be recounted in fiction. Attached to an order of nuns who had been working in the slums since the 1870s, Jennifer tells the story not only of the women she treated, but also of the community of nuns (including one who was accused of stealing jewels from Hatton Garden) and the camaraderie of the midwives with whom she trained. Funny, disturbing and incredibly moving, Jennifer&#39;s stories bring to life the colourful world of the East End in the 1950s.</p><p>Jennifer Worth trained as a nurse at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, and was later ward sister at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in London, then the Marie Curie Hospital, also in London. Music had always been her passion, and in 1973 she left nursing in order to study music intensively, teaching piano and singing for about 25 years. Jennifer died in May 2011 after a short illness, leaving her husband Philip, two daughters and three grandchildren. Her books have all been bestsellers.Worth gained her midwife training in the 1950s among an Anglican order of nuns dedicated to ensuring safer childbirth for the poor living amid the Docklands slums on the East End of London. Her engaging memoir retraces those early years caring for the indigent and unfortunate during the pinched postwar era in London, when health care was nearly nonexistent, antibiotics brand-new, sanitary facilities rare, contraception unreliable and families with 13 or more children the norm. Working alongside the trained nurses and midwives of St. Raymund Nonnatus (a pseudonym she's given the place), Worth made frequent visits to the tenements that housed the dock workers and their families, often in the dead of night on her bicycle. Her well-polished anecdotes are teeming with character detail of some of the more memorable nurses she worked with, such as the six-foot-two Camilla Fortescue-Cholmeley-Browne, called Chummy, who renounced her genteel upbringing to become a nurse, or the dotty old Sister Monica Joan, who fancied cakes immoderately. Patients included Molly, only 19 and already trapped in poverty and degradation with several children and an abusive husband; Mrs. Conchita Warren, who was delivering her 24th baby; or the birdlike vagrant, Mrs. Jenkins, whose children were taken away from her when she entered the workhouse. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <b>The Mind's Eye</b>, Sacks examines questions ranging from the primary experiences of how we perceive depth or color or motion to the complex matter of how different individuals have varied ways of thinking and experiencing or recreating the visual world. Like <b>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</b> and <b>An Anthropologist on Mars</b>, Sacks's new book is based primarily on individual stories&nbsp;&#x2014; including Sacks's own experience of an ocular tumor that left him unable to perceive depth. As always, he embeds these case histories in a rich historical and scientific context. Sacks goes beyond basic vision to explore perception, hallucination and the power of visualization, as well as the ocular effects of migraine, epilepsy and other conditions. Oliver Sacks is our perfect guide to the visual world, a realm that, it turns out, is much, much more complicated than we could have imagined.</p><p>OLIVER SACKS is a practising physician and the author of ten books, including <b>Musicophilia</b>, <b>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</b> and <b>Awakenings</b> (which inspired the Oscar-nominated film). He lives in New York City, where he is a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, and Columbia's first Columbia University Artist.<b>Sight Reading</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In January of 1999, I received the following letter:<br>&nbsp;<br>Dear Dr. Sacks,<br>&nbsp;<br>My (very unusual) problem, in one sentence, and in non-medical terms, is: I can&#x2019;t read. I can&#x2019;t read music, or anything else. In the ophthalmologist&#x2019;s office, I can read the individual letters on the eye chart down to the last line. But I cannot read words, and music gives me the same problem. I have struggled with this for years, have been to the best doctors, and no one has been able to help. I would be ever so happy and grateful if you could find the time to see me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sincerely yours,<br>Lilian Kallir<br>&nbsp;<br>I phoned Mrs. Kallir&#x2014; this seemed to be the thing to do, although I normally would have written back&#x2014; because although she apparently had no difficulty writing a letter, she had said that she could not read at all. I spoke to her and arranged to see her at the neurology clinic where I worked.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Kallir came to the clinic soon afterward&#x2014; a cultivated, vivacious sixty-seven-year-old woman with a strong Prague accent&#x2014; and related her story to me in much more detail. She was a pianist, she said; indeed, I knew her by name, as a brilliant interpreter of Chopin and Mozart (she had given her first public concert at the age of four, and Gary Graffman, the celebrated pianist, called her &#x201c;one of the most naturally musical people I&#x2019;ve ever known&#x201d;).<br>&nbsp;<br>The first intimation of anything wrong, she said, had come during a concert in 1991. She was performing Mozart piano concertos, and there was a last-minute change in the program, from the Nineteenth Piano Concerto to the Twenty-first. But when she flipped open the score of the Twenty-first, she found it, to her bewilderment, completely unintelligible. Although she saw the staves, the lines, the individual notes sharp and clear, none of it seemed to hang together, to make sense. She thought the difficulty must have something to do with her eyes. But she went on to perform the concerto flawlessly from memory, and dismissed the strange incident as &#x201c;one of those things.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Several months later, the problem recurred, and her ability to read musical scores began to fluctuate. If she was tired or ill, she could hardly read them at all, though when she was fresh, her sight-reading was as swift and easy as ever. But in general the problem worsened, and though she continued to teach, to record, and to give concerts around the world, she depended increasingly on her musical memory and her extensive repertoire, since it was now becoming impossible for her to learn new music by sight. &#x201c;I used to be a fantastic sight reader,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;easily able to play a Mozart concerto by sight, and now I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Occasionally at concerts she experienced lapses of memory, though Lilian (as she asked me to call her) was adept at improvising and could usually cover these. When she was at ease, with friends or students, her playing seemed as good as ever. So, through inertia, or fear, or a sort of adjustment, it was possible for her to overlook her peculiar problems in reading music, for she had no other visual problems, and her memory and ingenuity still allowed her a full musical life.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1994, three years or so after she had first noticed problems reading music, Lilian started to have problems with reading words. Here again, there were good days and bad, and even times when her ability to read seemed to change from moment to moment: a sentence would look strange, unintelligible at first; then suddenly it would look fine, and she would have no difficulty reading it. Her ability to write, however, was quite unaffected, and she continued to maintain a large correspondence with former students and colleagues scattered throughout the world, though she depended increasingly on her husband to read the letters she received, and even to reread her own.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pure alexia, unaccompanied by any difficulty in writing (&#x201c;alexia sine agraphia&#x201d;) is not that uncommon, although it usually comes on suddenly, following a stroke or other brain injury. Less often, alexia develops gradually, as a consequence of a degenerative disease such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s. But Lilian was the first person I had encountered whose alexia manifested first with musical notation, a musical alexia.<br>&nbsp;<br>By 1995 Lilian was beginning to develop additional visual problems. She noticed that she tended to &#x201c;miss&#x201d; objects to the right, and, after some minor mishaps, she decided that she had best give up driving.<br>&nbsp;<br>She had sometimes wondered whether her strange problem with reading might be neurological rather than ophthalmological in origin. &#x201c;How can I recognize individual letters, even the tiny ones on the bottom line of the eye doctor&#x2019;s chart, and yet be unable to read?&#x201d; she wondered. Then, in 1996, she started to make occasional embarrassing mistakes, such as failing to recognize old friends, and she found herself thinking of a case history of mine she had read years before, entitled &#x201c;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,&#x201d; about a man who could see everything clearly but recognize nothing. She had chuckled when she had first read it, but now she started to wonder whether her own difficulties might be eerily similar in nature.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, five years or more after her original symptoms, she was referred to a university neurology department for a full workup. Given a battery of neuropsychological tests&#x2014; tests of visual perception, of memory, of verbal fluency, etc.&#x2014;Lilian did particularly badly in the recognition of drawings: she called a violin a banjo, a glove a statue, a razor a pen, and pliers a banana. (Asked to write a sentence, she wrote, &#x201c;This is ridiculous.&#x201d;) She had a fluctuating lack of awareness, or &#x201c;inattention,&#x201d; to the right, and very poor facial recognition (measured by recognition of photographs of famous public figures). She could read, but only slowly, letter by letter. She would read a &#x201c;C,&#x201d; an &#x201c;A,&#x201d; a &#x201c;T,&#x201d; and then, laboriously, &#x201c;cat,&#x201d; without recognizing the word as a whole. Yet if she was shown words too quickly to decipher in this way, she could sometimes correctly sort them into general categories, such as &#x201c;living&#x201d; or &#x201c;nonliving,&#x201d; even though she had no conscious idea of their meaning.<br>&nbsp;<br>In contrast to these severe visual problems, her speech comprehension, repetition, and verbal fluency were all normal. An MRI of her brain was also normal, but when a PET scan was performed&#x2014; this can detect slight changes in the metabolism of different brain areas, even when they appear anatomically normal&#x2014; Lilian was found to have diminished metabolic activity in the posterior part of the brain, the visual cortex. This was more marked on the left side. Noting the gradual spread of difficulties in visual recognition&#x2014; first of music, then of words, then of faces and objects&#x2014; her neurologists felt she must have a degenerative condition, at present confined to the posterior parts of the brain. This would probably continue to worsen, though very slowly.<br>&nbsp;<br>The underlying disease was not treatable in any radical sense, but her neurologists suggested that she might benefit from certain strategies: &#x201c;guessing&#x201d; words, for example, even when she could not read them in the ordinary way (for it was clear that she still possessed some mechanism that allowed unconscious or preconscious recognition of words). And they suggested that she might also use a deliberate, hyperconscious inspection of objects and faces, making particular note of their distinctive features, so that these could be identified in future encounters, even if her normal &#x201c;automatic&#x201d; powers of recognition were impaired.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the three years or so that had elapsed between this neurological exam and her first visit to me, Lilian told me, she had continued to perform, though not as well, and not as frequently. She found her repertoire diminishing, because she could no longer check even familiar scores by vision. &#x201c;My memory was no longer fed,&#x201d; she remarked. Fed visually, she meant&#x2014; for she felt that her auditory memory, her auditory orientation, had increased, so that she could now, to a much larger degree than before, learn and reproduce a piece by ear. She could not only play a piece in this way (sometimes after only a single hearing); she could rearrange it in her mind. Nonetheless, there was, on balance, a shrinkage of her repertoire, and she began to avoid giving public concerts. She continued to play in more informal settings and to teach master classes at the music school.<br>&nbsp;<br>Handing me the neurological report from 1996, she commented, &#x201c;The doctors all say, &#x2018;Posterior cortical atrophy of the left hemisphere, very atypical,&#x2019; and then they smile apologetically&#x2014; but there&#x2019;s nothing they can do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When I examined Lilian, I found that she had no problem matching colors or shapes, or recognizing movement or depth. But she showed gross problems in other areas. She was unable now to recognize individual letters or numerals (even though she still had no diffi culty writing complete sentences). She had, too, a more general visual agnosia, and when I presented her with pictures to identify, it was difficult for her even to recognize pictures <i>as </i>pictures&#x2014; she would sometimes look at a column of print or a white margin, thinking it was the picture I was quizzing her about. Of one such picture, she said, &#x201c;I see a V, very elegant&#x2014; two little dots here, then an oval, with little white dots in between. I don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s supposed to be.&#x201d; When I told her it was a helicopter, she laughed, embarrassed. (The V was a sling; the helicopter was unloading food supplies for refugees. The two little dots were wheels, the oval...</p><h2>MirrorMask (children&#39;s edition)</h2><p><p>Helena is about to embark on a most amazing journey.</p><p>Raised in a family of circus performers, she's always dreamed of leading a more ordinary life.

Illustrated by Charles W. Schwartz.</p><p>Published in 1949, shortly after the author's death, <i>A Sand County Almanac</i> is a classic of nature writing, widely cited as one of the most influential nature books ever published. Writing from the vantage of his summer shack along the banks of the Wisconsin River, Leopold mixes essay, polemic, and memoir in his book's pages. In one famous episode, he writes of killing a female wolf early in his career as a forest ranger, coming upon his victim just as she was dying, "in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes.... I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, no wolves would mean hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view." Leopold's road-to-Damascus change of view would find its fruit some years later in his so-called land ethic, in which he held that nothing that disturbs the balance of nature is right. Much of <i>Almanac</i> elaborates on this basic premise, as well as on Leopold's view that it is something of a human duty to preserve as much wild land as possible, as a kind of bank for the biological future of all species. Beautifully written, quiet, and elegant, Leopold's book deserves continued study and discussion today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>A profoundly affecting work.

No one had ever seen anything quite like Hair, which celebrated hippie values and earned its notoriety as much for its nudity as for its use of rock music and its controversial themes. It addressed topics (race, sexual liberation, youth culture) that were unheard of at the time. This illustrated authorized history chronicles the musical&#x2019;s beginnings from its off-Broadway roots in New York&#x2019;s East Village in 1967 to its successful 2009 Broadway revival. When it first appeared, it was condemned as vulgar and a death knell to Broadway. The book discusses the play&#x2019;s obscure origins when James Rado and Gerome Ragni borrowed a typewriter from their landlord in Hoboken, New Jersey, to write a first draft of what would become Hair, the initial media response, the lawsuits over the nude scenes, its touring productions around the world, and such iconic counterculture figures as Allen Ginsberg and Mick Jagger.

In her younger days, she traveled the exotic parts of the world with her husband. These days, she&#x2019;s retired and founded the local charity shop. Her niece, Megan Pencarrow, transferred nearby, and was recently promoted to the rank of Detective Sargent. Perhaps the only downside is that she is now working for a DI who doesn&#x2019;t approve of women on the police force and who really doesn&#x2019;t much approve of Megan&#x2019;s aunt Eleanor, as she is something of a thorn in his rather substantial side. <p></p>All of these factors collide when, the day after collecting donations, Eleanor and the vicar&#x2019;s wife find the dead body of a longhaired, scruffy-looking youth hidden in the stockroom of the charity shop. Then they discover that some donated jewelry thought to be fake is actually very real, very expensive, and the haul from a violent robbery in London. Making matters more complex, the corpse found in the storeroom is apparently not one of the robbers. Carola Dunn's <i>Manna from Hades </i>is a confounding Cornish case of daring theft, doublecross, and a wily older woman confronted by a case of murder most foul.</p><p>Born and raised in England, C AROL A DUNN is the author of nearly fifty novels, including the long-running Daisy Dalrymple mystery series.Set in Cornwall "somewhere in the 1960s and '70s" (per an author note), this lively first in a new cozy series from British veteran Dunn (<i>Death at Wentwater Court</i>) introduces Eleanor Trewynn, a plucky widow who runs a charity shop in the village of Port Mabyn. Eleanor gets entangled in a murder investigation after she and her curious dog, Teazle, happen on a dead body of what first appears to be a tramp in the shop storeroom. Eleanor exasperates Detective Inspector Scumble as her less than perfect memory trickles out details of her discovery. Scumble, whose partner is on sick leave, doesn't relish pursuing the case with Eleanor's determined niece, Det. Sgt. Megan Pencarrow, who has to continually prove herself to the gruff, old-school inspector. Adept at showing character through witty dialogue, Dunn paints an amusing picture of a small town that readers will want to visit again soon. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This may be more of that. My evenings are free once I have locked up the Youth Center. Maybe I should have written semi-free. I read whenever I can, the lives of good and decent men and women who sought God and found Him.<br>I am not like that&#x2014;either I have never lost Him or I have never sought Him. When you read this, you can say which. I have already confessed many times, but I think someone ought to tell my story. I am no autobiographer, just the only one who knows it.<br>I was ten, I think, when my father and I moved to Cuba. The communists had lost power, and my father was going to run a casino in Havana. Some monks had reopened an old monastery outside the city, and they were trying to start a boarding school. After a few years, my father signed me up. I think he must have given the monastery fifty thousand or so, because nothing was said about payment in all the years I was there&#x2014;nothing I remember.<br>A year seems like a lifetime at that age, so three or maybe four lifetimes passed before I went from being a student to being a novice in the order. You would think I would remember something like that better than I do. All that I recall is that the Novice Master called us together one day and explained that the abbot had given up the idea of a school. The parents who did not want their sons to enter the order would come and take them home.<br>Most of my friends left after that. My father did not come, so I became a novice.<br>I see I have gotten ahead of myself, which happens a lot whenever I try to talk in public. I should tell you first that up to then I had gone home for holidays. Not all of them but some, like Christmas, and for eight weeks in the summer, every summer until then.<br>After that, my father never came for me again. I talked to my confessor about it, and he explained that being a novice was different. My father could not come anymore. He could have written letters, but he never did.<br>It was still like going to school. I helped Brother Ignacio herd our pigs and weed the garden, and there were novenas and mass and vespers and whatnot. But we had always done those. We still had classes and grades and all that. Now I know the subjects we studied were just the ones various monks could teach, but they knew a lot and it was a pretty good education. Most of them were from Mexico and most of the kids from Cuba, so we spoke Spanish in the monastery. The kids&#x2019; Spanish was a little different, but not a whole lot. Mass was in Spanish at first, Latin later on.<br>A lot of what I learned there was languages. We did two at a time: Spanish and Latin for a year, French and English the next year, then Spanish and Latin again the year after. Like that. I had picked up quite a bit of Italian from my father and his friends, English was what we had spoken at my school in the States, and I had gotten a good bit of Spanish just living in Havana before I went to the monastery. So I did not do too badly. I was not anybody&#x2019;s star pupil in languages, but I was not at the bottom of the class in any of them. Or even close to it.<br>Besides the languages we got a lot of theology, like you would expect, and liturgy, Bible studies, and so forth. I guess all of us thought we would be priests eventually, and maybe the monks did, too, or some did.<br>We took biology every year. We called it biology, but a whole lot of it was about sex. If we became priests as well as monks we would have to hear confessions. Some of them would be the confessions of other monks, but two or three of our priests went into Havana almost every Friday and Saturday to help out in various parishes, and one of the things they did was hear the confessions of the laity. Not just men, but women too. I used to daydream about having this beautiful woman come into the confessional and say, &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s wrong to lust after a priest, Father, but I can&#x2019;t help myself. It&#x2019;s Father Chris. Every time I see him I want to tear off all my clothes.&#x201d; One time I told my confessor about those daydreams, but he just laughed. I did not like it, and I like it even less now. I pray that God will strike me down before I ever do that to anyone.<br>We learned about all the perversions, or at least about all those our teacher knew about, and that was a lot. Some were pretty funny, but some were just horrible. There was a lot about homosexuality, how bad it was, and how we must love the sinner but not the sin. That stuff was one reason I left the monastery. I will get to that soon.<br>Math was my best subject. We got arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and geometry, plain and solid. Most of the kids griped about math, but I loved it. Pretty soon I caught on to what Fr. Luis was doing for tests. He would assign certain problems in the book for homework. The problems he had not assigned would show up on his tests. I got wise and worked all the problems. I got quite a few hundreds on my tests, and hardly ever had a test come back lower than ninety-seven. Fr. Luis used to brag about me when I was not around. Two or three of the other monks told me about it. I can never repay Fr. Luis for teaching me math&#x2014;geometry and trig, especially. I know he is in Heaven.<br>Those were the main subjects we took, but Fr. Patrizio had a telescope and used to point out all the stars to us, and tell us about them, and how you could see the Southern Cross once you crossed the equator. He was from Argentina, and he must have been lonely for the stars he grew up with. So we did not actually study astronomy&#x2014;nobody thought we would have to know it&#x2014;but I found the stars beautiful and interesting, and I picked up a lot from him.<br>We took music, too. I like music a lot, but I did not like or even understand the things we studied in music, and I always wanted to play faster than I was supposed to.<br>After a while the old kids were mostly gone, a few new ones had come, and nobody wore wristwatches anymore. (I noticed that.) Mass was in Latin instead of Spanish, and everybody seemed a little calmer. Fr. Patrizio was dead or gone or something. I missed some of the old kids and some of my old teachers. But basically I liked it better.<br>One day the Novice Master came into music class to take me to the abbot. I had heard his homilies two or three times, but I am not sure I had ever spoken to him until then. On feast days we were at one end of the table and the abbot was at the other, so we never talked. There were at least two abbots while I was there. Maybe three. I remembered my father saying abbots brought you down, and I was sure I was not going to like him and that it was going to be bad news.<br>Which in a way it was. I did like him, though, and by the time we were through talking I liked him a lot. By then I knew I had hurt him, too, and felt bad about it.<br>He was a lot shorter, and pretty old. I remember the lines on his face, and how shy his eyes were. Now I think he must have known right from the start that I was looking to lie to him. (Sometimes I have wondered what he thought about me, this skinny gringo kid who was going to sit there and lie to him. Some other times I have been glad I do not know.)<br>He said that it was time my novitiate was over, that I had to decide now whether I would take my solemn vows at Easter. He talked a little about his own life outside the monastery. His father had been a cobbler and had taught him the trade. Then he talked a lot about his life as a monk, how he used to mend sandals for the other monks, and all the monastery had meant to him. He talked about God, and devoting your life to Him. He asked a lot of questions about me, too. What the monastery had been like for me, and what my life outside had been like.<br>By the time he asked for my decision I had already thought it over, though perhaps it was not really thinking but only what kids call thinking. I said that I was not ready yet to take my vows. That I wanted to go home and see my father and have a chance to talk things over with him and with myself.<br>The abbot sighed, but I do not think he was surprised. He said, &#x201c;I comprehend you. Will you promise me something, Cris�foro?&#x201d; (Everything was in Spanish, but I might as well translate for you because I do not remember the exact words we used anyhow.)<br>I said it would depend on what the promise was.<br>&#x201c;A very small thing, Christopher. To make an old man happy?&#x201d;<br>I said I would try. By then I was pretty sure it was going to be about sex, probably to keep away from women.<br>For a minute or two he sat there studying me. His eyes had probably been sharp once, but they were too kind to be sharp anymore. &#x201c;I would like a better promise than that,&#x201d; he said at last, &#x201c;but I shall settle for that one, since I must. I want you to promise that you will never forget us.&#x201d;<br>I said, &#x201c;Wait, you don&#x2019;t understand. I&#x2019;ll probably come back,&#x201d; and I talked a lot about that, going on and on and repeating things I had said already. Lying.<br>Finally he cut me off. He said I was free to go. If I wanted to say good-bye to people I could stay that night.<br>I said, &#x201c;No, Reverend Abbot, I want to go right now,&#x201d; and after that he called for Brother Ignacio.<br>Brother Ignacio took me to the gate. He never said a single word to me. Not one. Only when I turned back to wave good-bye, he was crying. There have been times since then when I thought I understood how he felt.<br>I had taken off my habit and put on the clothes I used to wear back when I went home for the summer, my T-shirt and jeans. They were way too small for me now, but that was all I had. I started walking down the road dres...</p><h2>Violence of Action</h2><p>Back from self-imposed exile, the Rogue Warrior enters a whole new phase of his amazing career.

Outside, a cool mist had descended over the deserted, tree-lined street. Raindrops pattered a soothing rhythm against the car's roof and windows. The small, yellow flames of the neighborhood's gas streetlamps flickered weakly against the gloom. Extraordinarily expensive, they'd been selected for their graceful lines, not their usefulness.

The camera zoomed in on the civil rights attorney's face as he pontificated about his latest legal victory. It had to be said, Beckstein was not a handsome man. His weary face was riddled with deep age lines and irregular patches of discolored skin, suggesting years of overexposure to the sun. A shock of longish, ill-kept, iron gray hair sprouted from his oblong skull. For an instant, his eyes, deeply set in cave-like sockets, seemed to stare directly at the man in the car. "You're a tired old fuck, aren't you?" the man whispered to himself. The electronic file played through a few other similar video clips and then ended.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He checked his watch, a simple Swiss Army officer's model on a stainless-steel band. It was time to move. He'd dressed appropriately for tonight's occasion in a lightweight black wool suit, a black turtleneck, and hand-sewn black leather lace-up shoes with rubber soles. His powerful hands were encased in a pair of thin, black leather shooting gloves. Soft and supple as a baby's skin. The overall effect suggested a stylish, modern-day grim reaper. Appropriate indeed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>His right front coat pocket held a tight fitting assault mask -- a black Nomex balaclava. The mask would conceal his most noticeable feature, a nasty scar running dead center across his forehead. The deep channel was the result of an unfortunate encounter with a Russian rocket-propelled grenade during the invasion of Panama.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He shut off the DVD player, set it on the seat beside him, then slipped an S&amp;W Model 13 .357 Magnum revolver out of the sturdy leather shoulder holster beneath his left armpit. His hand-tailored suit coat concealed the weapon perfectly. The revolver's blued cylinder was loaded with six rounds, each a 158-grain soft lead, hollow base wadcutter seated backwards inside a shiny brass casing. He'd designed and tested the round himself. Upon contact with soft tissue or bone, it would reliably expand to roughly the size of a .70-caliber projectile. Satisfied his weapon was ready, he returned the revolver to its holster.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There was no one in sight on the street as he slid from the cozy warmth of the Lexus. He softly closed and locked its door behind him and began the half-block walk through the damp night air to Beckstein's home. Strolling casually along the wet sidewalk he keyed a pre-programmed number for the lawyer's private line into his cell phone. After several rings Beckstein answered.</p><p></p><p>r"Yes?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Samuel? Ed Curry here. Still okay to drop by?" </p><p></p><p></p><p>"Ed!" exclaimed Beckstein. The lawyer's voice assumed its nationally famous courtroom drawl. "Wonderful of you to call. Yes, yes of course. You're close?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>Closer than you think, cocksucker, the advancing gunman thought to himself. "Yes, Samuel. Just around the corner. Home alone?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Yes," Beckstein replied. "My bodyguard is off tonight. Fucking some sweet little bitch barely over the legal age, or so I'm told."</p><p></p><p></p><p>The man in black smiled. "Some guys have all the fun. See you soon."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I'll deactivate the security gate," said Beckstein. "Come straight up to the front door and I'll let you in."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't be but a minute." He didn't wait for a response, but punched the end button on the phone and slid it back into his jacket pocket.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Reaching the house's outer perimeter, he took out the ominous black hood and pulled it over his head in one practiced motion. A subtle adjustment here and there ensured a seamless fit. He pushed open the wrought iron security gate just wide enough to slip past it. He stopped, listening and watching for anything unexpected. The rain was falling harder now. Big, fat drops of icy-cold water hammered against the top of the executioner's hood and soaked into his powerful shoulders. Sensing nothing unusual, he swiftly mounted the short flight of steps leading up to a massive front door of lustrous, dark wood. As his research had indicated, the townhouse's exquisitely restored Federal facade hadn't been marred by anything as practical as an exterior security camera, or even a low-tech peephole in the door. Why bother to employ some musclebound bodyguard if you couldn't take the most basic precautions yourself, he wondered? The asshole deserved whatever he got.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He eased the big Magnum revolver free of its holster and rapped its heavy, 3" barrel against the door. Moments later he heard the deadlock turning from the inside. His every muscle prepared to strike.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As soon as he felt the door opening his whole body sprang forward hard. His left hand violently pushed the door aside as he exploded into the foyer. The astonished Beckstein stumbled backwards as the inside doorknob flew from his grasp and the masked intruder exploded into his home.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The man smashed the butt of the revolver into Beckstein's face, crushing his nose and producing a spray of broken cartilage and rich red blood. As the lawyer's hands instinctively flew upward to protect his now ruined nose, the gunman raised his revolver level with Beckstein's gleaming forehead and pulled its custom-tuned trigger. No explanation, no hesitation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Beckstein's face caved in as the lead wadcutter burrowed its way through his forehead and into his cranium. The soft, wide mouth of the bullet began expanding upon contact and reached an impressive .72-caliber in diameter by the time it ruptured the attorney's brain. It proceeded to punch a massive chunk of bone out of the back of his skull. Sloppy, pinkish-red gobs of pulped brain matter were sucked through the jagged hole as the lead chunk exited, landing with a satisfying splatter on the foyer's walls and floor.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Beckstein never knew what -- or who -- hit him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Keeping the Magnum on target, the killer watched as Beckstein's body slumped to the floor. Then he straddled the fallen figure and fired a second bullet directly into the oozing mass of Beckstein's face. "If you were ugly in life," he whispered, "you're a beautiful motherfucker in death!" Dropping all of his weight onto one knee, he delivered a massive crunch to the center of Beckstein's chest. The sternum-shattering blow released a harsh spray of foamy red bubbles from the man's unmoving lips. Holstering the revolver, the killer slipped a microcassette tape from his front pants pocket and placed it next to the dead man's shattered skull.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As he rose, the hollow chime of an antique wall clock began to toll midnight. He stepped over the dead attorney like he was stepping over a piece of rotten meat and silently padded through the foyer to a large, lavishly decorated reception room. Moving swiftly across the room's glistening parquet floors and museum-quality Oriental rugs, he made his way to a side door that opened directly into a corner of the back garden. Slipping past a jumble of patio furniture, he located the rear gate exactly where he'd been told it would be, obscured behind a thick cascade of slippery green ivy. Once through the gate, he was in a long, narrow alleyway that allowed service people discreet access to the grand houses that lined these blocks. He slipped down the dimly lit alley keeping to the shadows, avoiding the garbage cans neatly stacked behind each house he passed. His pace was cautious but even. As he moved steadily away from the night's killing ground he scanned his flanks and rear for anyone foolish or unlucky enough to follow him, but he was all alone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>At the end of the long alley, he found the tan Mazda coupe that ha...</p></p><h2>Scratching the Woodchuck: Nature on an Amish Farm by Kline, David (1999) Paperback</h2><p>New copy.

It was an epoch of glory and success, of disaster and despair. Twenty years after the South won the Civil War, America writhed once more in the bloody throes of battle. Furious over the annexation of key Mexican territory, the United States declared total war against the Confederate States of America. And so, in 1883, the fragile peace was shattered.<br><br>But this was a new kind of war, fought on a lawless frontier where the blue and gray battled not only each other, but the Apache, the outlaw, and even the redcoat. Along with France, England entered the fray on the side of the South, with blockades and invasions from Canada. <br><br>Out of this tragic struggle emerged figures great and small. The disgraced Abraham Lincoln crisscrossed the nation championing socialist ideals. Confederate cavalry leader Jeb Stuart sought to prevent wholesale slaughter in the desert Southwest, while cocky young Theodore Roosevelt and stodgy George Custer bickered over modern weapons--even as they drove the British back into western Canada.<br><br>Thanks to the efforts of journalists like Samuel Clemens, the nation witnessed the clash of human dreams and passions.

Ben Hogan was a short, trim, impeccably dressed Texan whose fierce work ethic, legendary steel nerves, and astonishing triumph over personal disaster earned him not only an army of adoring fans, but one of the finest careers in the history of the sport. Hogan captured a record-tying four U.S. Opens, won five of six major tournaments in a single season, and inspired future generations of professional golfers from Palmer to Norman to Woods.<br><br>Yet for all his brilliance, Ben Hogan was an enigma. He was an American hero whose personal life, inner motivation, and famed &#x201c;secret&#x201d; were the source of great public mystery. As Hogan grew into a giant on the pro tour, the combination of his cool outward demeanor and invincible, laser-guided accuracy on the golf course froze formidable opponents in their tracks. In 1949, at the peak of his career, Hogan&#x2019;s mystique was reinforced by a catastrophic automobile accident in which he and his wife, Valerie, were nearly killed after being hit head-on by a Greyhound bus. Doctors predicted Hogan might never walk again &#x2013; let alone set foot on another golf course. But his miraculous three-year recovery and comeback led to one of the greatest performances in golf history when in 1953 he won the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the British Open (something that&#x2019;s never been repeated). <br><br>In this first-ever family-authorized biography, renowned author James Dodson expertly and emotionally reconstructs Hogan&#x2019;s complicated life. He discovers an intensely honest man handicapped by self-doubt, buoyed by the determination to prove his own abilities, and unable to escape a long-buried childhood tragedy &#x2013; the core of the Hogan &#x201c;secret.&#x201d; Dodson also reveals both the legendary devotion and eventual strain in Hogan&#x2019;s sixty-two-year marriage, and a Hogan rarely seen by the public: a warm, jovial man whose charitable spirit and sharp business sense enabled him to build the powerful golf equipment company bearing his name to this day. Ben Hogan: A Life is the authoritative inside portrait golf fans have long awaited.</p></p><p><p><b>JAMES DODSON</b> is the author of bestselling <i>Final Rounds</i>, which was named the Golf Book of the Year by the International Network of Golf in 1996.

It occupied a limestone rise of forested hills that were notable for their clear running creeks and abundance of wild turkey, prairie chicken, and free-ranging buffalo.<br><br>The Comanche, Kiowa, Lipan, and Apache tribes who hunted these bleak surrounding lands, undisturbed for centuries before white settlers pushed into the region, were more than a little reluctant to give them up to the newcomers, and thus Dublin's early town records are filled with vivid accounts of deadly skirmishes between uninvited homesteaders and native inhabitants, family massacres, and revenge killings.<br><br>As late as the start of the twentieth century, surviving elements of these "pacified" native peoples periodically committed violent raids on Dublin township for horses and cows, and a year seldom passed without the murder of a farmer or disappearance of a town resident caught unaware in some isolated outlying area. "My grandmother used to say this was God's country," remembers a modern resident of Dublin whose family roots burrow back to the town's formation. "He put this nice little Christian town smack in the middle of a country that was meaner than hell. Reckon only He could truly love it."<br><br>One popular account of how Dublin got its name holds that it came from the shouted alert to "double in the wagons! Indians a'comin'!" though the abundance of Irish surnames in local graveyards suggests the founding fathers were probably more intent upon honoring their distant homeland when Dublin actually appeared on government land maps around 1860. A less likely if more colorful theory holds that the name derived from the raucous Double Inn Hotel that opened up about the time the railroad arrived to serve the needs of a more prosperous crossroads economy, a notorious roadhouse that specialized in strong drink and cheap beds.<br><br>Five years after the Yuma Stagecoach Line made Dublin a regular stop in 1874, the Texas Central Railroad surveyed a line straight through the heart of town and opened a small depot there in 1881, prompting an influx of cattlemen and cotton farmers aiming to seek their fortunes on the edge of a wild new country. One of those who came to town was a young, rawboned Mississippian looking for a new start. William Alexander Hogan had spent a year serving as a blacksmith in a Confederate cavalry unit before taking a bride four years his senior and settling down to try to raise cotton on rented land back in Mississippi. After five years of hard tenant labor that left the Hogans with little or nothing to show for their efforts, William and Cinthia Hogan pulled up stakes and joined the migration to the promised land of west Texas, arriving in Dublin sometimes after 1870 with their four young children: William, Josephine, Martha, and Mary. According to Sunday school records, they joined the First Baptist Church almost immediately upon arriving in town, and William abandoned farming in favor of the trade he'd learned in the Confederate Army.<br><br>Whether by chance or design, the opening of a new blacksmith shop on Elm Street, just a block or so from the center of town, was fortuitously timed because the same railroad that brought settlers into the formerly untamed region also brought cattle ranchers and cotton farmers in growing numbers, people who relied heavily on the horse for their livelihoods and transportation needs.<br><br>On February 2, 1885, a fifth and final child was born to the Hogans, a solemn dark-eyed boy they called Chester, possibly after the outgoing president of the United States. At an early age, according to early family lore--what little of it managed to pass down the line--Chester Hogan was drawn to the dust and bustle of his father's workplace, often spending his days at the blacksmith shop tending horses and watching customers come and go. He was said to be an unusually sweet-dispositioned child given to periods of prolonged silence.<br><br>In 1889 a spur of the larger Fort Worth-Rio Grande Railroad reached Dublin and an opera house opened its ornate doors, featuring dance hall girls and the kind of rowdy frontier melodramas that soon attracted patrons from as far away as Fort Worth and Dallas. One of those who found himself attracted to the town's mix of the Old West and the new ways was Sam Houston Prim, a former bookstore owner who contracted to produce and bottle a carbonated concoction that was all the rage down in Waco, a sweet soda beverage called Dr. Pepper. Sensing an opportunity to get the jump on merchants restricted to peddling the newfangled soda drink from their traditional lunch counters around the Lone Star State, Prim opened his small bottling plant with the greater ambition to make Dr. Pepper available at every general store and grocery purveyor in west Texas. To do so, he hired his brother and a nephew to mix chilled carbonated water and flavored syrup in Hutchinson bottles, which could then be sealed with wire corks and shipped imperishably anywhere there were good roads or rail lines. The idea caught on like a fever, and Prim was soon expanding his operation and looking for extra hands to bottle and ship his soda. In due course, Prim hired the quiet but hardworking youngest son of William Hogan to wash returned bottles, refill and cork them, and crate them up for shipment.<br><br>Chester Hogan was believed to be twenty years old and already married the spring he briefly left his father's blacksmith shop to bottle Dr. Pepper, and in a famous photograph that the Dublin Progress newspaper published in 1955--half a century later--the youngest Hogan appears erect and taciturn, with an almost Lincoln-like solemnity and bearing about the eyes, remarkably like the two sons he would father within a decade. Not long after the photograph appeared in print, the newspaper's editor received a pair of politely worded letters from golfer Ben Hogan, the first requesting a "glossy print of this original picture at your earliest possible convenience," the second a short while later expressing the letter writer's deep appreciation for a prompt reply and dispatch of the photograph in question. Neither letter made even passing reference to the fact that the man in the photograph was Ben Hogan's father.<br><br>Chester Hogan, in any case, was married to the former Clara Williams, third child of a Dublin cotton buyer who grew up in a rented house on nearby Grafton Street, a short time after he went to work for Sam Prim. Her father, Ben Williams, a prominent member of the Baptist church, was remembered as being a fastidious dresser and a quick-witted man who could instantly work out the most complicated math problems in his head even while simultaneously transacting purchases of bundled bails of raw cotton that were brought from the fields by the wagonload to the Dublin train depot. It was Williams's job to grade and purchase bails of raw cotton fiber, then mark and ship them on for processing to northern clothing and thread manufacturing companies. For his trouble, he collected 10 percent of every consummated purchase.<br><br>Cotton was king across much of the American South in those days, and Ben Williams had social ambitions that probably didn't include his pretty, spirited daughter marrying the silent heir of the village smithy shop.<br><br>As a Fort Worth reporter snooping around in Ben Hogan's mysterious early life in the late 1950s first discovered--but chose not to reveal--there was apparently no marriage certificate between Chester Hogan and Clara Williams filed anywhere in the courthouse records of Erath or neighboring Comanche County, leading some to surmise that the young couple may simply have eloped or quietly gone off and married in a hurry, owing to an impending arrival. In any case, from family sources it's known that Clara was eighteen in 1908 when she gave birth for the first time to a boy she rather fancifully named Royal Dean. Two years later a daughter was born at home, probably at the young couple's modest wooden frame house on Camden Street. Projecting her ambitions for a more refined life on her first and only female child, Clara named the girl Chester Princess.<br><br>Finally, on August 13, 1912, a few days after the Bull Moose Party nominated Theodore Roosevelt for president and advocated a platform promoting women's suffrage and sweeping election reform, Clara Hogan delivered a second son at the new women's infirmary in nearby Stephensville, the county seat. For reasons unclear--possibly having to do with her natural distrust of strangers or the dying western tradition that held all newborns should be properly named at home (it was bad luck to do otherwise)--Mama Hogan chose not to give the baby a formal name until she brought her infant male home to Dublin.<br><br>Both Royal Dean and Princess were remembered by Dublin elders as lively babies who seemed to possess their mama's extroverted nature, but the third Hogan issue had both his father's calm and watchful personality and his mother's imposing blue-gray eyes. Clara eventually decided to call him William Ben Hogan, after both his grandfathers, the diligent blacksmith and the enterprising cotton broker, a pretty good choice considering the way young Bennie turned out in life.<br>Except for his modestly phrased letters of inquiry and gratitude to the Dublin Enterprise, sent and received during the summer of 1955--the year he just missed winning a record fifth National Open and announced his intention to "retire" from full-time professional golf to pursue "other int...</p><h2>Deceived by Shame, Desired by God: Includes a Twelve-Week Bible Study (Women of Wisdom Series)</h2><p>Rape, incest, alcoholism, addiction, abortion.

This toxic emotion often convinces us we are irreparably damaged at our very core. And, sadly, the hurt doesn&#x2019;t end there. All too often, shame brings about additional self-destructive behavior, and the never-ending cycle of sin and shame continues, leading us even further from a relationship with God.

This question, rarely asked before the end of the Cold War, has in recent years become a major focus of historical and ideological strife. In this sequence of reflective and critical studies, Samuel Moyn engages with some of the leading interpreters of human rights, thinkers who have been creating a field from scratch without due reflection on the local and temporal contexts of the stories they are telling.<br><br> Having staked out his owns claims about the postwar origins of human rights discourse in his acclaimed <i>Last Utopia</i>, Moyn, in this volume, takes issue with rival conceptions&#x2014;including, especially, those that underlie justifications of humanitarian intervention</p><p><b>Samuel Moyn</b> is professor of law and history at Harvard University. He is the author of <i>The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History</i>, and <i>Christian Human Rights</i> (2015), among other books, as well as editor of the journal <i>Humanity</i>. He also writes regularly for <i>Foreign Affairs</i> and <i>The Nation</i>.&#x201c;An intensely readable journey ... Moyn reminds us that the idea of human rights did not begin with the Second World War and is not an American invention; that individual rights and human dignity are not the same thing; that torture is a relatively recent taboo; that humanitarian intervention (the use of military force to &#x2018;civilise&#x2019;) offers certain dangers; and that newly arrived ideas of international criminal justice and courts will not offer an easy salvation. Moyn&#x2019;s impulses are critical yet he recognises what he calls the &#x2018;global radiance&#x2019; of human rights in our times. There have been failures but also successes, so he seeks a &#x2018;reinvention&#x2019; rather than a replacement. If human rights are to make a practical difference, to be more than an &#x2018;ornament on a tragic world which they do not transform&#x2019;, he wants them to be able to mobilise people, to be less centred on judges and more attentive to real economic and social needs. At a time of growing inequality, within and across borders, the last point will surely resonate, along with the broader underlying message: that the ideas underpinning modern human rights have become a fundamental part of our political culture, and that we ignore history at our peril.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Phillippe Sands, <i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A brilliant scholar, and in <i>Human Rights and the Uses of History</i> he shows his intellectual heft.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;B�cquer Segu�n, <i>Jacobin</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Tidy, coherent, and invigorating ...

There he met Shivas Irons, golf pro and mystic, and in a single day and night he had his life -- and his game -- transformed. In the two decades since it was first published, Golf in the Kingdom has been recognized as a classic on the deeper mysteries of golf, a gospel for those who suspect, or know, that golf is more than a mere pastime.</p><p>Esalen Institute founder Michael Murphy's divine meditation on the royal and ancient game defied categorization when it was first published in 1972, and it still does. Instantly hailed as a classic, <i>Golf in the Kingdom</i> is an altogether unique confluence of fiction, philosophy, myth, mysticism, enchantment, and golf instruction. The central character is a wily Scotsman named Shivas Irons, a golf professional by vocation and a shaman by design, whom Murphy, as participant in his own novel, meets in 1956 on the links of Burningbush, in Fife. The story of their round of golf together culminates in a wild night of whiskey and wisdom where, as Shivas demonstrates how the swing reflects the soul, their golf quite literally takes on a metaphysical glow. The events alter not only Murphy's game, but they also radically alter his mind and inner vision; it's truly unforgettable. For a golfer, Murphy's masterpiece is as essential as a set of clubs.A classic tale of sport and mysticism, here in a brand new audio production.<p>"Michael Murphy was on his way from California to India when he met Shivas Irons on a golfing links he calls Burningbush, in Scotland. They played 18 holes together and had a second go at the devilish 13th hole in the middle of a wild whiskey night--a mythic round that profoundly altered Murphy's game and his vision. . .

A pre-Christian folk religion traceable to "Oriental syncretism"? How do we account for the disparate ideas, writings, and practices that have been placed under the Gnostic rubric? To do so, Karen King says, we must first disentangle modern historiography from the Christian discourse of orthodoxy and heresy that has pervaded--and distorted--the story. </p><p> Exciting discoveries of previously unknown ancient writings--especially the forty-six texts found at Nag Hammadi in 1945--are challenging historians of religion to rethink not only what we mean by Gnosticism but also the standard account of Christian origins. <i>The Gospel of Mary</i> and <i>The Secret Book of John</i>, for example, illustrate the variety of early Christianities and are witness to the struggle of Christians to craft an identity in the midst of the culturally pluralistic Roman Empire. King shows how historians have been misled by ancient Christian polemicists who attacked Gnostic beliefs as a "dark double" against which the new faith could define itself. Having identified past distortions, she is able to offer a new and clarifying definition of Gnosticism. Her book is thus both a thorough and innovative introduction to the twentieth-century study of Gnosticism and a revealing exploration of the concept of heresy as a tool in forming religious identity. </p></p><p><b>Karen L.

Javaka Steptoe's bold artwork offers a stunning new interpretation of the reassuring, lyrical text and brings to yet another generation of children this well-loved story.</p></p><p><p>Charlotte Zolotow&#x2014;author, editor, publisher, and educator&#x2014;has one of the most distinguished reputations in the field of children's literature. She has written more than seventy books, many of which are picture-book classics, such as <em>Mr. Rabbit and the Lovely Present</em> and <em>William's Doll</em>. She lives in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.</p>Steptoe's (In Daddy's Arms, I Am Tall) bold mixed-media collages invigorate Zolotow's (Mr. Rabbit and the Lovely Present) tender 1958 tale of a girl's affection for her brother. As Zolotow's poetic images flow in a rhythmic question-and-answer format ("Do you know what I'll do when it snows?/ I'll make you a snowman./ / Do you know what I'll do when the wind blows?/ I'll put it in a bottle and let it loose when the house is hot"), Steptoe responds in kind. He depicts a bottle of wind containing snowflakes and a tiny image of the snowman built by the girl in a prior spread. His stunning illustrations, comprised of painted plywood, cardboard and paper, along with fabric, ribbons, buttons, seashells and so on, create layered, almost three-dimensional portraits of the striking African-American siblings. Their love for each other is tangible, yet he injects the same playfulness and humor inherent in the text. For "Do you know what I'll do at the movies?/ I'll remember the song and sing it to you," Steptoe shows the sister striking a Billie Holiday pose, complete with flower hair ornaments and a fuchsia feather boa. Simple, rounded lines and a resonant white backdrop set off the brilliant colors (fans of John Steptoe's work can't help but notice a resemblance). Both author and artist prove they know how to convey a strong sense of familial love. Ages 3-7.

With <em>Common Sense</em>, Thomas Paine energized colonial support for the armed rebellion that would make the American experiment a reality, using common sense to argue for colonial independence.

Published in Philadelphia in January of 1776, <i>Common Sense</i> sold 150,000 copies almost immediately. A powerful piece of propaganda, it attacked the idea of a hereditary monarchy, dismissed the chance for reconciliation with England, and outlined the economic benefits of independence while espousing equality of rights among citizens.

In college and graduate school, he received degrees in English literature and elementary education. Despite his unrelated degrees, one of his first jobs after finishing graduate school was as a research assistant in a marine biology laboratory. Working on a project to study some of the denizens of the salt marsh, he quickly became fascinated with this ever-changing, ever-beautiful habitat. For the last seven years, he has combined all of these experiences as a marine educator and curriculum writer. During this time, he has written and edited the South Carolina Aquarium&#39;s award-winning K-8 curriculum, as well as curriculum activities for the World Wildlife Fund, NOAA, and the College of Charleston&#39;s COASTeam project. He is currently the newsletter editor for SeaScripts, the newsletter of the South Carolina Marine Educators Association. A Day in the Salt Marsh is his first published children&#39;s book. Kevin currently resides in the lowcountry of South Carolina where he spends a lot of time reading and exploring the natural world.This attractive picture book looks at the&nbsp;flora and fauna&nbsp;of the salt marsh. On each spread, rhyming verses begin with the time of day and go on to comment on an animal or a plant: "It's two o'clock in the salt marsh. / A fish, small and tiny / swimming all around the grass / with scales so small and shiny. / The marsh is like a nursery / where little fish can hide. / They eat the food that's brought their way / with each new rising tide." The&nbsp;sensitive, precisely rendered artwork, which shows up particularly well from a distance, uses three overlapping scenes on a spread that neatly&nbsp;work together to show the salt marsh as a whole while offering close-ups of details. Appendixes include a matching game and illustrated paragraphs on the importance of salt marshes, the effects of tidal changes on inhabitants, and the cause of the oceans' tides.

Since her mother&#39;s death, eighteen-year-old half-French, half-Vietnamese Nicole has been living in the shadow of her beautiful older sister, Sylvie. When Sylvie is handed control of the family silk business, Nicole is given an abandoned silk shop in the Vietnamese quarter of Hanoi. But the area is teeming with militant rebels who want to end French rule, by any means possible. For the first time, Nicole is awakened to the corruption of colonial rule - and her own family&#39;s involvement shocks her to the core... Tran, a notorious Vietnamese insurgent, seems to offer the perfect escape from her troubles, while Mark, a charming American trader, is the man she&#39;s always dreamed of. But who can she trust in this world where no one is what they seem? The Silk Merchant&#39;s Daughter is a captivating tale of dark secrets, sisterly rivalry and love against the odds, enchantingly set in colonial era Vietnam.</p><p>Dinah Jefferies was born in Malaysia and moved to England at the age of nine. Her idyllic childhood always held a special place in her imagination, and when she began writing novels in her 60s, she was able to return there - first in her fiction and then on annual research trips for each new novel. Dinah Jefferies is the author of four novels, The Separation, The Tea Planter&#39;s Wife - a Number One Sunday Times bestseller, The Silk Merchant&#39;s Daughter and Before the Rains. She lives in Gloucestershire.A captivating tale of dark secrets, sisterly rivalry and love against the odds, enchantingly set in colonial era Vietnam * Publisher&#39;s description * A captivating story, an exotic and richly imagined setting, sibling rivalry, romance, l couldn&#39;t put it down * Julia Gregson * What a vivid and well-researched story!

Be prepared to be swept away by this wonderful book. I couldn&#39;t put it down and loved every delicious page. Dinah Jefferies has a remarkable gift for conjuring up another time and place with lush descriptions, full of power and intensity. I was totally captivated by its passionate and dangerous story of Nicole, as she fights to find her place in the turmoil of 1950s Vietnam, torn between loyalty and love.

As an exposition of encouragement and exhortation, Hebrews addresses the central concerns of our contemporary church as well: the felt absence of God, a climate of uncertainty and insecurity, the tension between secular conformity and spiritual maturity and the treat of societal perversion and materialism to a Christian commitment. Christians are called upon to express a faith that is rooted in the future and to continue this life of pilgrimage with a radical new view of reality, which is based on sure confidence in the intervention of God in daily life. Tracing the writer&#39;s development thought by thought, rather than verse by verse, careful attention is paid to the cultural and historical background. This work is useful as a study guide for groups and individuals, or for any reader who wishes a mature understanding of the book of Hebrews.</p><p></p><h2>The Peter Rabbit Library 10 Books Collection Gift Set</h2><p>Beatrix at her Bewitching Best From Peter Rabbit to Jemima Puddle-Duck, every one of Beatrix Potter&#39;s delightful tales can be found in this marvelous set.

Their talented playwright is at work on his next opus, set to open in a few short weeks, and the group's trusty stage manager and reliable problem-solver Nicholas Bracewell is looking forward to a productive and calm season. <br><br>Unfortunately for Nicholas, his friendship with Frank Quilter, a young actor who's just joined the troupe, is about to cause him a lot of trouble. Frank's father has been arrested and accused of a murder he didn't commit, and before anyone can figure out what to do he's convicted and hanged for his crime. Destroyed, young Frank promises to avenge his father, at the expense of the play Westfield's Men have contracted to perform. Nicholas, who's loyalty is split between the company and his new friend, agrees to help Frank on condition that he fulfill his obligations as an actor. <br><br>Enter an unlikely ally in the form of one Moll Comfrey, a comely young saleswoman with more to sell than meets the eye. She has the key to the whole mystery hidden somewhere on her person, and it's up to Nicholas to find out what she's hiding (by whatever means necessary) before the theater, not to mention Frank's life, goes dark. <br></p><p>On top of the usual, waggishly presented intrigues facing Elizabethan London's most calamity-prone theater company, Westfield's Men, come still more dire threats, in Edward Marston's <i>The Bawdy Basket</i>: The troupe risks losing both its creative genius and its financial backing. Troubles begin with the execution of Gerald Quilter, a prosperous businessman unjustly convicted of murder, whose son Frank has recently joined Westfield's Men. Despite his fellow actors' misgivings, Frank is determined to clear his father's name, and Nicholas Bracewell, the company's stage manager and resourceful troubleshooter, agrees to help--even if it costs him his job. Meanwhile, playwright Edmund Hoode, renowned for his unrequited romances ("Your whole life is one long, desperate, lovesick sigh," another player reminds him), seems finally to have found a woman to share his heart. Yet she insists that Hoode forsake the stage and pen sonnets solely in her tribute. As disaster looms in his troupe's future, Bracewell's search for reasons behind the framing of Gerald Quilter leads to a young woman peddler, and also attracts the predatory attention of a moneylender anxious to bankrupt the pleasure-seeking patron of Westfield's Men.<p> Marston, a prolific author of historical mysteries (also published under his real name, Keith Miles), vividly re-creates the scents and sensibilities of 16th-century England, with carefully applied strokes of humor. This 12th installment of his Nicholas Bracewell series offers fewer insights into its protagonist than did <i>The Silent Woman</i>, and slightly less menace than <i>The Roaring Boy</i>. But its intricate conspiracies and swashbuckling action give <i>The Bawdy Basket</i> dramatic urgency deserving of repeated ovations. <i>--J.

They view the religious environment as a free market economy, where churches compete for souls. The story they tell is one of gains for upstart sects and losses for mainline denominations. Although many Americans assume that religious participation has declined in America, Finke and Stark present a different picture. In 1776, fewer than 1 in 5 Americans were active in church affairs. Today, church membership includes about 6 out of 10 people. But, as Finke and Stark show, not all denominations benefited from this growth. They explain how and why the leading eighteenth-century churches began their descent, while two newcomer sects, the Baptists and the Methodists, gained ground. They also analyze why the Methodists then began a long, downward slide, why the Baptists continued to succeed, how the Catholic Church met the competition of ardent Protestant missionaries, and why the Catholic commitment has declined since Vatican II. The authors also explain why ecumenical movements always fail. In short, Americans are not abandoning religion; they have been moving away from established denominations. A &#34;sect-church process&#34; is always under way, Finke and Stark argue, as successful churches lose their organizational vigor and are replaced by less worldly groups. Some observers assert that the rise in church membership rates indicates increased participation, not increased belief. Finke and Stark challenge this as well. They find that those groups that have gained the greatest numbers have demanded that their followers accept traditional doctrines and otherworldliness. They argue thatreligious organizations can thrive only when they comfort souls and demand sacrifice. When theology becomes too logical, or too secular, it loses people.</p><p>Roger Finke is a Professor of Sociology and Religious Studies at The Pennsylvania State University and Director of the Association of Religion Data Archives.

Though the real perpetrator has since been convicted, three of the four remain in prison today, attesting to the powerful role confessions&#x2014;even false ones&#x2014;play in our criminal justice system, where they typically trump fact, reason, and common sense.<br><br>Writer Tom Wells and law professor Richard Leo masterfully interweave a narrative covering the unfolding of the case with an exploration of topics ranging from coercive interrogation, police perjury ("testilying"), and prosecutorial politics to the role of the death penalty in criminal law.<br><br>With a clemency campaign for the three wrongly imprisoned men still ongoing, this book presents an urgent call for justice and a convincing case for reform in the criminal justice system.</p><p><b>Tom Wells</b> is the author of <i>The War Within: America's Battle over Vietnam</i> among other books. He lives in Boulder, Colorado. An expert in false confessions, <b>Richard A. Leo</b> is the author of <i>Police Interrogation and American Justice</i> and is an associate professor of law at the University of San Francisco. He lives in San Francisco. Wells and Leo spent six years closely following the case and ultimately helped to secure legal representation for the Norfolk Four's ongoing clemency campaign.In a case echoing John Grisham's <i>The Innocent Man,</i> two experts in interrogation and false confessions unfold the story of four men who, under duress by the police, all pleaded guilty to the same crime. In 1997, 19-year-old sailor Billy Bosko came home to Norfolk, Va., from a naval tour to find his wife, Michelle, viciously raped and stabbed to death. Police hastily concluded that the Boskos' neighbor, another young sailor named Danial Williams, was the murderer, and after a lengthy interrogation and being told falsely that he'd failed a polygraph test, he confessed. But with DNA evidence not supporting his guilt, police, rather than letting Williams go, looked for accomplices. Eventually three other sailors, Joseph J. Dick Jr., who boarded with Williams, and Eric Wilson and Derek Tice, faced similar treatment, and all pleaded guilty. The DNA evidence and a letter in the police's hands actually pointed to another, far more credible suspect, but police clung to their theory, and Williams plea-bargained and the others were convicted at trial. The authors passionately relate the case of the Norwalk Four as a tragic one in which facts were not allowed to interfere with a good theory, and the justice system failed to do justice. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923 when she was 19. Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and over 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.A number of minor catastrophes occur at the Ivory family's art gallery. A priceless vase is broken. A special catalog is charred to ash. A painting on exhibition is slashed. When a body is found in a cupboard, the police are called. While Allingham is masterful at characterization, mood, and detail, she has chosen to add omniscient comments such as, "They went on their predestined ways, unaware." These do nothing to advance the story and, in fact, become intrusive. Nonetheless, Francis Matthews's performance will delight Allingham's fans. His rendering of Gabrielle Ivory, the 90-year- old matriarch who chastises the modern generation for its lack of moral fortitude, is elegant and graceful; his country constable is bumbling yet cagey. Matthews provides the necessary dramatic tension to an engaging, if predictable, plot.

[Lacey's] work manages to be both conceptual and human, socially aware and mordant&#x2015;think DeLillo for millennials&#x2015;[and it] captures the absurdity of a culture that persists in thinking that enlightenment is a matter of the right purchase, hashtag, or Google search." &#x2015;Megan O'Grady, <i>Vogue</i><br><i></i><br><i>"</i>The genius of Catherine Lacey lies in the fact that her new book, <i>The Answers,</i> doesn&#x2019;t feel like too much; the pieces are bizarre and timely and fit together like puzzle pieces into a somehow timeless examination of humanity . . . Lacey&#x2019;s prose radiates elegance beneath its unassuming, unflashy surface; there&#x2019;s nary a maladroit word or an unrevealing detail. She skillfully balances a truly absurd array of hot-button topics and weird narrative twists, playing them off each other virtuosically to weave a surreal-feeling story with deeply pragmatic concerns." &#x2015;Claire Fallon, <i>Huffington Post</i></p><p><i>"</i>Lacey pulls off a diverting and provocative satire, studded with episodes of real gravity, without engaging in slapstick. The ironies are buried deep in the novel&#x2019;s symmetrical structure and never played for laughs, though there are enough deadpan comic revelations to qualify Lacey, as some critics have already suggested, as an heir to Don DeLillo in <i>White Noise </i>mode. " &#x2015;Christian Lorentzen, <i>New York</i></p><p>"Catherine Lacey examines, with clinical chill and precision, late-capitalism's perversions of love . . . <i>The Answers</i> cinches [Lacey's previous accolades] while forging new narrative territory. It's more plot-driven and ruthless than <i>Nobody Is Ever Missing</i>, a world more familiar with the carnal cruelty of a Mary Gaitskill story than Adler's aphoristic prose . . ." &#x2015;J. Jezewska Stevens, <i>BOMB</i></p><p>"Complex and haunting . . . Masterful . . . Lacey writes loneliness and solitude with a profound depth, injecting life into the anxious fluttering of those wondering, wandering individuals who just don&#x2019;t know what to do with themselves and who can&#x2019;t stop asking life&#x2019;s most impenetrable questions." &#x2015;Laura Adamcyzyk, <i>The A.V. Club</i></p><p>"[<i>The Answers</i>] directs [its] energy into an unpredictable, layered plot that will likely take most readers by surprise . . . For Lacey's remarkable skill to be fully embraced, we may need a new genre to categorize her work under . . . Her sentences are like reading an iconic prose style before it&#x2019;s become iconic." &#x2015;Joshua James Amberson, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p><p>"For a novel that&#x2019;s so cerebral, <i>The Answers</i> is impressively tightly plotted and Lacey&#x2019;s prose notably refined in its lucidity. It&#x2019;s an exciting and clever follow-up to her acclaimed debut, <i>Nobody Is Ever Missing</i>, and testifies to her inclusion on Granta&#x2019;s recent best of young American novelists list . . . <i>T</i><i>he Answers</i> is an unsettling, but whip-smart meditation on love, intimacy and contemporary female experience, minus the fairytale ending." &#x2015;Lucy Scholes, <i>The Independent </i></p><p>"Catherine Lacey is one of the most intelligent and brittle and funny writers of her generation. In <i>The Answers</i>, she builds&#x2015;out of the raw stuff of bewilderment and absence&#x2015;a soaring, heartbreaking work that's just on the right side of being nearly too beautiful to bear." &#x2015;Lauren Groff, author of <i>Fates and Furies</i></p><p>"Remarkable . . . Lacey displays an exceptional ability to articulate the elusiveness of knowing others, as well as the desire to find meaning and trust within." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)</p><p>"Startling and stunning and compulsively strange, Lacey's sophomore novel is a haunting investigation into the nature of love . . . With otherworldly precision and subtle wit, Lacey creates a gently surreal dreamscape that's both intoxicating and profound. A singular novel; as unexpected as it is rich." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus </i>(starred review)</p><p>"Lacey is particularly attuned to the emotional elasticity of her female characters, especially as they face problems that can <i>feel</i> physically taxing . . . [She] makes it easy to believe women, which has been, as we all know, perhaps the hardest thing to do from a narrative standpoint at any particular time in history . . . Lacey manages to entertain us as she makes a point about women on the fringe." &#x2015;Kaitlin Phillips, <i>Bookforum</i></p><p>"An adept novel . . . Lacey digs into the choppy turf beneath a woman's relationship to her body, her identity and her search for balance between independence and meaningful relationships . . . Lacey doesn't give us answers, but she sure gives us a wild story with a memorable protagonist." &#x2015;<i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>"Surreal, thought-provoking, and intriguingly untidy" &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p></p><h2>Immortal in Death (Thorndike Press Large Print Famous Authors Series)</h2><p>Mid-twenty-first-century NYC lieutenant Eve Dallas investigates the brutal murder of an ambitious top model, a case that threatens Dallas&#39;s own life when suspicion falls on her best friend.</p><p>Nora Roberts is the number-one New York Times-bestselling author of more than 150 novels, including High Noon, Angels Fall, Blue Smoke, and Northern Lights.

Eve wasn&#x2019;t sure how it had happened in the first place. She was a cop, for God&#x2019;s sake. Throughout her ten years on the force, she&#x2019;d firmly believed cops should stay single, unencumbered, and focused utterly on the job. It was insane to believe one person could split time, energy, and emotion between law, with all its rights and wrongs, and family, with all its demands and personalities.</p><p>Both careers&#x2014;and from what she&#x2019;d observed, marriage was a job&#x2014;had impossible demands and hellish hours. It might have been 2058, an enlightened time of technological advancement, but marriage was still marriage. To Eve it translated to terror.</p><p>Yet here she was on a fine day in high summer&#x2014;one of her rare and precious days off&#x2014;preparing to go shopping. She couldn&#x2019;t stop the shudder.</p><p>Not just shopping, she reminded herself as her stomach clutched, shopping for a wedding dress.</p><p>Obviously she&#x2019;d lost her mind.</p><p>It was Roarke&#x2019;s doing, of course. He&#x2019;d caught her at a weak moment. Both of them bleeding and bruised and lucky to be alive. When a man is clever enough and knows his quarry well enough to choose such a time and place to propose marriage, well, a woman was a goner.</p><p>At least a woman like Eve Dallas.</p><p>&#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re about to take on a gang of chemi-thugs bare-handed.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve tugged on a shoe, flicked her gaze up and over. He was entirely too attractive, she thought. Criminally so. The strong face, poet&#x2019;s mouth, killer blue eyes. The wizard&#x2019;s mane of thick black hair. If you managed to get past the face to the body, it was equally impressive. Then you added that faint wisp of Ireland in the voice, and, well, you had one hell of a package.</p><p>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;m about to take on is worse than any chemi-head.&#x201d; Hearing the whine in her own voice, Eve scowled. She never whined. But the truth was, she&#x2019;d have preferred fighting hand to hand with a souped-up addict than discussing hemlines.</p><p>Hemlines, for sweet Christ&#x2019;s sake.</p><p>She bit back an oath, watching him narrowly as he crossed the spacious bedroom. He had a way of making her feel foolish at odd times. Like now as he sat beside her on the high, wide bed they shared.</p><p>He caught her chin in his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hopelessly in love with you.&#x201d;</p><p>There he was. This man with the sinfully blue eyes, the strong, gorgeous, somehow Raphaelite looks of a doomed angel, loved her.</p><p>&#x201c;Roarke.&#x201d; She struggled to hold back a sigh. She could and had faced an armed laser in the hands of a mad mutant mercenary with less fear than she faced such unswerving emotion. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going through with it. I said I would.&#x201d;</p><p>His brow quirked, dark and wry. He wondered how she remained so unaware of her own appeal as she sat there, fretting, her poorly cut fawn-colored hair standing up in tufts and spikes, aroused by her restless hands, thin lines of annoyance and doubt running between her big, whiskey-colored eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Darling Eve.&#x201d; He kissed her, lightly, once on the frowning lips, then again in the gentle dip in her chin. &#x201c;I never doubted it.&#x201d; Though he had, constantly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve several things I have to see to today. You were late last night. I never had a chance to ask if you had plans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The stakeout on the Bines case went to after oh three hundred.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Walked right into my arms&#x2014;blissed on dreamers and a marathon VR session.&#x201d; She smiled, but it was the hunter&#x2019;s smile, dark and feral. &#x201c;Murdering little bastard came along like my personal droid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then.&#x201d; He patted her shoulder before rising. He stepped down from the platform into the dressing area where he pondered a selection of jackets. &#x201c;And today? Reports to file?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m off today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; Distracted, he turned back, a gorgeous silk jacket in deep charcoal in his hand. &#x201c;I can reschedule some of my afternoon, if you like.&#x201d;</p><p>Which would be, Eve mused, a bit like a general rescheduling battles. In Roarke&#x2019;s world, business was a complicated and profitable war. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m already booked.&#x201d; The scowl snuck back on her before she could stop it. &#x201c;Shopping,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;Wedding dress.&#x201d;</p><p>Now he smiled, quickly, easily. From her, such plans were a declaration of love. &#x201c;No wonder you&#x2019;re so cranky. I told you I&#x2019;d see to it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick out my own wedding dress. And I&#x2019;ll buy it myself. I&#x2019;m not marrying you for your damn money.&#x201d;</p><p>Smooth and elegant as the jacket he slipped on, he continued to smile. &#x201c;Why are you marrying me, Lieutenant?&#x201d; Her scowl deepened, but he was, above all, a patient man. &#x201c;Want a multiple choice?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you never take no for an answer.&#x201d; She stood, shoving her hands into the front pockets of her jeans.</p><p>&#x201c;You only get a half point for that. Try again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;ve lost my mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t win you the trip for two to Tropic World on Star 50.&#x201d;</p><p>A reluctant smile tugged at her lips. &#x201c;Maybe I love you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you do.&#x201d; Content with that, he crossed back to her and laid his hands on her strong shoulders. &#x201c;How bad can it be? You can pop a few shopping programs into the computer, look at dozens of suitable dresses, order in what appeals to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was my idea.&#x201d; She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Mavis ditched it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mavis.&#x201d; He paled a bit. &#x201c;Eve, tell me you&#x2019;re not going shopping with Mavis.&#x201d;</p><p>His reaction brightened her mood a little. &#x201c;She has this friend. He&#x2019;s a designer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dear Christ.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She says he&#x2019;s mag. Just needs a break to make a name for himself. He has a little workshop in Soho.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s elope. Now. You look fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Her grin flashed. &#x201c;Scared?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Terrified.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Now we&#x2019;re even.&#x201d; Delighted to be on level footing, she leaned in and kissed him. &#x201c;Now you can worry about what I&#x2019;ll be wearing on the big day for the next few weeks. Gotta go.&#x201d; She patted his cheek. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting her in twenty minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eve.&#x201d; Roarke grabbed for her hand. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t do something ridiculous?&#x201d;</p><p>She tugged her way free. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting married, aren&#x2019;t I? What could be more ridiculous?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>She hoped he stewed over it all day. The idea of marriage was daunting enough, but a wedding&#x2014;clothes, flowers, music, people. It was horrifying.</p><p>She zipped downtown on Lex, braking hard and muttering curses at a sidewalk vendor who encroached on the lane with his smoking glide cart. The traffic violation was bad enough, but the scent of overcooked soydogs hit her nervous stomach like lead.</p><p>The Rapid cab behind her broke the intercity noise pollution code by blasting his horn and shouting curses through his speaker. A group, obviously tourists, loaded down with palm cams, compumaps, and binoks gaped stupidly at the whizzing traffic. Eve shook her head as a quick-fingered street thief elbowed through them.</p><p>When they got back to their hotel, they were going to find themselves several credits poorer. If she&#x2019;d had the time and a place to pull over, she might have given the thief a chase. But he was lost in the crowd and a block across town on his air skates before she could blink.</p><p>That was New York, she thought with a faint smile. Take it at your own risk.</p><p>She loved the crowds, the noise, the constant frantic rush of it. You were rarely alone, but never intimate. That&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;d come here so many years ago.</p><p>No, she wasn&#x2019;t a social animal, but too much space and too much solitude made her nervous.</p><p>She&#x2019;d come to New York to be a cop, because she believed in order, needed it to survive. Her miserable and abusive childhood with all its blank spaces and dark corners couldn&#x2019;t be changed. But she had changed. She had taken control, had made herself into the person some anonymous social worker had named Eve Dallas.</p><p>Now she was changing again. In a few weeks she wouldn&#x2019;t just be Eve Dallas, lieutenant, homicide. She&#x2019;d be Roarke&#x2019;s wife. How she would manage to be both was more of a mystery to her than any case that had ever come across her desk.</p><p>Neither of them knew what it was to be family, to have family, to make a family. They knew cruelty, abuse, abandonment. She wondered if that was why they had come together. They both understood what it was to have nothing, to be nothing, to know fear and hunger and despair&#x2014;and both had remade themselves.</p><p>Was it just mutual need that attracted them? Need for sex, for love, and the melding of the two that she had never thought was possible before Roarke.</p><p><i>A question for Dr. Mira,</i> she mused, thinking of the police psychiatrist she often consulted.</p><p>But for now, Eve determined that she wasn&#x2019;t going to think about the future or the past. The moment was complicated enough.</p><p>Three blocks from Greene Street, she seized her chance and squeezed into a parking space. After searching through her pockets, she found the credit tokens the aging meter demanded in its moronic and static jumbled tones and plugged in enough for two hours.</p><p>If it took any more than that, she&#x2019;d be ready for a tranq room and a parking citation wouldn&#x2019;t bother her in the least.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, sh...</p></p><h2>The Complete Verse and Other Nonsense</h2><p>The absurd and fanciful verses of Edward Lear-from &#34;The Owl and the Pussy-cat&#34; to &#34;The Jumblies,&#34; from &#34;The Scroobious Pip&#34; to countless limericks-have enchanted generations of readers, children and adults alike.

Who are we? We do we exist? What is our mission given the radical political, social, and economic changes that have occurred in this century? What does it mean to be &#34;church&#34; in a pluralistic, postmodern world?In an effort to answer these and related questions, denominations have rediscovered their origins and redefined themselves and their mission in ways that are consistent with their history. Additional research into denominational histories and the rewriting of these histories has been of significant import in helping today&#39;s churches relate to their times.David L. Holmes has produced a relatively concise, highly literary 400-year history of the Episcopal Church, its successes and its failures. He has clearly tied this history to the Anglican Reformation that emerged from Henry VIII&#39;s break with Roman Catholicism (an appendix on the annulment of Henry VIII has been included for those who may be unfamiliar with what precipitated the crisis between Henry and the Roman Church).This book, then, provides a readable and accurate account of the beginnings of the Anglican Church in America at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, to the establishment of the Protestant Episcopal Church in America after the War of Independence, to the present day. &#34;Although only sixth in terms of numbers in the United States,&#34; David Holmes concludes, &#34;the denomination that first appeared in the colonies as the Church of England 400 years ago has become substantially Americanized. It may be second to none in the nation in terms of power and influence.&#34;All who are interested in American church history and in the influence of the Episcopal Church on American history will find David Holmes&#39;s account fascinating and helpful.David L.

As we grow in our prayer life, John of the Cross is an excellent and encouraging guide to show us the way to the practice of contemplative prayer.<br><br>Many of us learned about mediation from spiritual directors or books. We practiced a reliable from of mediation for some years with varying degrees of success. Over time, however, our prayer slowed down and became simplified. We didn't find many new ideas to occupy our intellect and our emotions quieted down. In time, many of us experienced a crisis in our prayer life; our prayer became so simple that it almost disappeared. We tried different forms of prayer, but we seemed to be reaching a dead end. Throughout all of this, we were never told that our payer was developing naturally and positively. What we were experiencing was not a dead end but the threshold of a new way of prayer. What we needed was an experienced guide to show us the road ahead. <br><br>Enter John of the Cross! He encourages us to see that the place we came to is a necessary state of our progress in prayer. John teaches us that we come to contemplation not by struggling harder to pray but by calming remaining quiet before God. He encourages us to realize that we have not come to the end of the road but are being made ready to be transported on a wonderful journey. There is no better or more encouraging guide for us on this journey than John of the Cross. The entire focus of this book is quite narrow; it concentrates on John's teaching about the beginning of contemplation.</p><p></p><h2>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

When asked, people in the know will always list books by Benjamin Graham, Burton G. Malkiel's <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i>, and <i>Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings</i> by Philip A. Fisher. You'll know you're getting really good advice if they also mention <i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i> by Edwin Lef�vre. <p> <i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i> is the thinly disguised biography of Jesse Livermore, a remarkable character who first started speculating in New England bucket shops at the turn of the century. Livermore, who was banned from these shady operations because of his winning ways, soon moved to Wall Street where he made and lost his fortune several times over. What makes this book so valuable are the observations that Lef�vre records about investing, speculating, and the nature of the market itself. For example: </p><p> "It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight! It is no trick at all to be right on the market. You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I've known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine--that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon."</p><p> If you've ever spent weekends and nights puzzling over whether to buy, sell, or hold a position in whatever investment--be it stock, bonds, or pork bellies, you'll be glad that you read this book. <i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i> is full of lessons that are as relevant today as they were in 1923 when the book was first published. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p><b><i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i></b> <p>"... I learned early that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can&#x2019;t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again. I&#x2019;ve never forgotten that.... The fact that I remember that way is my way of capitalizing experience."<br> &#x2014;<b>from Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</b></p> <p>First published in 1923, <i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i> is the fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore, one of the greatest speculators who ever lived. Now, more than 70 years later, Reminiscences remains the most widely read, highly recommended investment book ever written. Generations of investors have found that it has more to teach them about themselves and other investors than years of experience in the market. They have also discovered that its trading advice and keen analyses of market price movements ring as true today as in 1923. Jesse Livermore won and lost tens of millions of dollars playing the stock and commodities markets during the early 1900s&#x2014;at one point making the thenastronomical amount of ten million dollars in just one month of trading. So potent a market force was he in his day that, in 1929, he was widely believed to be the man responsible for causing the Crash. He was forced into seclusion and had to hire a bodyguard. Originally reviewed in The New York Times as a nonfiction book, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator vividly recounts Livermore&#x2019;s mastery of the markets from the age cf 14. Always good at figures, he learns, early on, that he can predict which way the numbers will go. Starting out with an investment of five dollars, he amasses a fortune by his early twenties and establishes himself as a major player on the Street. He makes his first killing in 1906, selling short on Union Pacific. He goes on to corner the cotton market, and has a million-dollar day Bullish in bear markets and bearish among bulls, he claims that only suckers gamble on the market. The trick, he advises, is to protect yourself by balancing your investments, and selling big on the way down. Livermore goes broke three times, but he comes back each time feeling richer for the learning experience. Offering profound insights into the motivations, attitudes, and feelings shared by every investor, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is a timeless instructional tale that will enrich the lives&#x2014;and portfolios&#x2014;of today&#x2019;s traders as it has those of generations past.</p></p><h2>Comparing and Scaling - Ratios Rates Percents and Proportions, Connected Mathematics 3, Teacher&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Comparing and Scaling - Ratios Rates Percents and Proportions</p><p></p><h2>The Vulgar Boatman</h2><p>When his son is arrested for the brutal murder of a local girl, New England politician Tom Baron turns to lawyer-detective Brady Coyne for help</p><p>William G.

Joe Welsh, Bill Howes, and Kevin J. Holland are top-notch photo researchers and archivists, which they prove here with a great selection of 19th century glass-late photos, heavy-weight-era publicity photos, Pullman promotions and car diagrams, and some impressive postwar color action. The authors also have the good sense to go beyond train and car photos. Using photographer Jim Scribbins' candid interior view of the Seaboard Air Line's peerless Sun Lounge across a full spread is brilliant photo editing and typical of the entire book.

It is first and foremost a story of calculated terror and systematic violence.&#34; So begins Frank Dikotter&#39;s stunning and revelatory chronicle of Mao Zedong&#39;s ascension and campaign to transform the Chinese into what the party called New People. Following the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, after a bloody civil war, Mao hoisted the red flag over Beijing&#39;s Forbidden City, and the world watched as the Communist revolution began to wash away the old order. Due to the secrecy surrounding the country&#39;s records, little has been known before now about the eight years that followed, preceding the massive famine and Great Leap Forward. Drawing on hundreds of previously classified documents, secret police reports, unexpurgated versions of leadership speeches, eyewitness accounts of those who survived, and more, &#34;The Tragedy of Liberation&#34; bears witness to a shocking, largely untold history. Interweaving stories of ordinary citizens with tales of the brutal politics of Mao&#39;s court, Frank Dikotter illuminates those who shaped the &#34;liberation&#34; and the horrific policies they implemented in the name of progress. People of all walks of life were caught up in the tragedy that unfolded, and whether or not they supported the revolution, all of them were asked to write confessions, denounce their friends, and answer queries about their political reliability. One victim of thought reform called it a &#34;carefully cultivated Auschwitz of the mind.&#34; Told with great narrative sweep, &#34;The Tragedy of Liberation &#34;is a powerful and important document giving voice at last to the millions who were lost, and casting new light on the foundations of one of the most powerful regimes of the twenty-first century.&#34;</p><p>Frank Dikoetter is Chair Professor of Humanities at the University of Hong Kong. Before moving to Asia in 2006, he was Professor of the Modern History of China at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. He has published nine books about the history of China, including Mao&#39;s Great Famine, which won the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-fiction in 2011. http://www.frankdikotter.com/A brilliant and powerful account of the formation of that society ... Nobody who reads about the cost of the establishment of the PRC in Dikotter's humane and lucid prose will find much sympathy for the authoritarian case. This excellent book is horrific but essential reading for all who want to understand the darkness that lies at the heart of one of the world's most important revolutions * <b><i>Guardian</i></b> * Frank Dikoetter, now well into his stride as a meticulous chronicler of China's greatest miseries ... The Tragedy of Liberation is a tightly-written narrative of the twelve most pivotal years in modern Chinese history ... The book is also a dispassionate study of the way nations can pervert optimism and descend into lunacy by steady increments ... The Tragedy of Liberation is more unsettling. For what it tells us about the foundations of the modern Communist Party, and the backstory to so many decisions and statements made in Beijing today, it is essential reading * <i><b>The Times</b></i> * Frank Dikoetter's powerful new book is a bold and startling attempt to rectify this apparent neglect. In a cool, dispassionate narrative, Dikoetter recounts the orgy of violence which the communists set loose ... The Tragedy of Liberation demonstrates why he has established himself as a leading historian of modern China. He is a rare scholar, adept in both Russian and Chinese ... Dikoetter has a writer's gift in the use of English ... Dikoetter must be admired for the manner in which he puts a human scale on the enormous barbarities of the communist takeover of China. We cannot begin to understand modern China without being aware of the blood-drenched tale Dikoetter so ably relates * <b>Kwasi Kwarteng, <i>Evening Standard</i></b> * A mesmerizing account of the communist revolution in China, and the subsequent transformation of hundreds of millions of lives through violence, coercion and broken promises. The Chinese themselves suppress this history, but for anyone who wants to understand the current Beijing regime, this is essential background reading * <b>Anne Applebaum</b> * This follow up to Dikoetter's award-winning Mao's Great Famine examines the early bloodstained years of Communist China * <b><i>The Times</i>, Critics' Choices</b> * One-party states take control of the past as they take control of societies. Usually they must end for serious historical discussion to begin. A great intellectual challenge of our century is to historicize the People's Republic even as it continues to exist. Dikoetter performs here a tremendous service by making legible the hugely controversial origins of the present Chinese political order * <b>Tim Snyder</b> * Dikotter's third volume in the series will treat the larger-scale violence of the Cultural Revolution, so unlimited access might slow him up somewhat. But if I know Frank Dikotter, it will not stop him * <i><b>Independent</b></i> * A history of early Maoist China puts paid to any notion of a "golden age" ... In The Tragedy of Liberation ... Frank Dikotter convincingly demolishes this rosy assessment of the early People's Republic ... The book is a remarkable work of archival research. Dikotter rarely, if ever, allows the story of central government to dominate by merely reporting a top-down directive. Instead, he tracks down the grassroots impact of Communist policies - on farmers, factory workers, industrialists, students, monks - by mining archives and libraries for reports, surveys, speeches and memoirs. In so doing, he uncovers astonishing stories of party-led inhumanity and also popular resistance ... Dikotter sustains a strong human dimension to the story by skilfully weaving individual voices through the length of the book * <i><b>Financial Times</b></i> * This groundbreaking book examines the bloodstained reality behind the word and reveals how it brought tragedy to millions. Frank Dikotter is already the author of a revelatory book about China's great famine of 1958-62, and in this prequel - unsparing in its detail, relentless in its research, unforgiving in its judgments - he deals in the same way with the Chinese revolution from 1945 to 1957 ... This exhaustive trawl through Chinese archives charts the full cost of those early years of change ... Dikotter's achievement in this book is remarkable. He has mastered a mass of original source material, and has done so by mining local archives in China, which have yielded up a host of treasures. (Significantly, scholars are now reporting the steady closure of official records, as local bureaucrats revert to old habits of secrecy and isolation. This may be the last work of its kind for a while.) ... Staggering amount of detail ... For many years, histories of China have treated the 1950s as if the decade was an interlude of reason. That belief does not survive contact with this book ... It is clear to this reviewer, at least, that mainstream academic scholarship must also be revised in the light of Dikotter's work. In particular, volume 14 of the Cambridge History of China, which covers the period of this book, will have to be rewritten * <b><i>Sunday Times</i></b> * Path-breaking ... Some of what Dikotter describes has been known in general terms, but what he has done here - as when he was writing about the later famine - is take advantage of the opening of archives in which firsthand official reports and accounts of death in all its forms, together with the myriad other forms of Maoist horror, can now be read unedited. It will be increasingly difficult for Western China specialists to write with authority based only on previous Western publications or on Chinese public statements. We remain in Frank Dikotter's debt * <b><i>Literary Review</i></b> * With a mixture of passion and ruthlessness, he marshals the facts, many of them recently unearthed in party archives. Out of these, Mr Dikotter constructs a devastating case for how extreme violence, not a moral mandate, was at the heart of how the party got to power, and of how it then governed ... He was ready to lead the country into the giant experiment of the Great Leap Forward. Mr Dikotter has already written about that in "Mao's Great Famine", which this book only betters. The final volume of his planned trilogy will be on the Cultural Revolution, bringing the curtain down on a truly disastrous period * <b><i>Economist</i></b> * Frank Dikotter's powerful new book is a bold and startling attempt to rectify this apparent neglect. In a cool, dispassionate narrative, Dikotter recounts the orgy of violence which the communists set loose ... The Tragedy of Liberation demonstrates why he has established himself as a leading historian of modern China. He is a rare scholar, adept in both Russian and Chinese ... Combined with this linguistic skill, Dikotter has a writer's gift in the use of English. The narrative of The Tragedy of Liberation is always clear and simple ... Dikotter ... Must be admired for the manner in which he puts a human scale on the enormous barbarities of the communist takeover of China. We cannot begin to understand modern China without being aware of the blood-drenched tale Dikotter so ably relates * <b><i>Scotsman</i></b> * Unsparing reappraisal of China's communist revolution * <i><b>Sunday Times</b></i><b> Must Reads</b> * Frank Dikotter, Professor of Humanities at the University of Hong Kong, is establishing himself as the chronicler of what happened to the most populous nation on Earth during Mao's 27-year reign ... Dikotter's great achievement is to have melded together the big picture of Mao with the smaller one of what was happening to millions of victims of his policies. In doing so he's produced a book that's as authoritative as it is gripping * <b><i>Mail on Sunday</i></b> * Much of what Dikoetter describes has been known in outline; but Chinese history will have to be revised in light of his detailed revelations * <i><b>The Week</b></i> * The historian of China Frank Dikoetter has taken a sledgehammer to demolish perhaps the last remaining shibboleth of modern Chinese history ... What emerges from the archives with new clarity is just how ruinous Mao's policies were * <b><i>Spectator</i></b> * A meticulous reappraisal of the formative years of Maoist rule ... This is the first study to make sense in detail of events central to the Mao era, of which only the broad outlines have been known before now. It deserves to become fundamental to a better understanding of the forces that have shaped China today * <b><i>Sunday Telegraph</i></b> * Startling ... Dikoetter's work has aimed to demolish almost every claim to truth or virtue the Chinese Communist party ever made. He combines a vivid eye for detail with a historian's diligence in the archives. Powerful ... Dikoetter is unsparing in his account of the effects of the communist rule * <b><i>Observer</i></b> * A compelling and devastating account of the Communist involvement in the Civil War and of the first eight years of Communist rule ... This is a gripping and fluidly written account of the first decade of the People's Republic of China; one that contributes to bringing Chinese history into popular discussions of 20th century international revolutions, utopianism, violence and terror * <b><i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b> * Brilliant * <i><b>The Times</b></i> * Catalogues in devastating detail the suffering endured from 1949 to 1957, during the installation of the world's most murderous totalitarian regime ... [his portrait of Mao is] both harsher and more convincing than ever * <b><i>Oldie</i></b> * By the end of Dikoetter's shocking book, you are in no doubt about the dreadful murderousness of the communist leadership, whose land reforms and modernisation plans exacted a terrible toll on China's rural population. In this nightmarish world, not even leper colonies were safe * <i><b>Sunday Times</b></i><b> History Books of the Year</b> * The great merit of Dikoetter's book is that it goes beyond the horrific statistics ...

There's a UN embargo forbidding any member country from supplying arms to either side in the uprisings, but Andy Bokus, head of the CIA's London Station, has evidence that the weapons being smuggled into Yemen are not only being sold to both sides, but are coming from a connection in the UK-a highly embarrassing black mark on the government and, if true, full of disastrous consequences. </p><p> British-American cooperation widens as Liz teams up with her old rival Bruno McKay, MI6's Head of Station in Paris, and Isobel Florian of the French domestic service, the DCRI, to trail and trap the elusive weapons dealer. The evidence points to a former French intelligence officer, Antoine Milraud, who leads them all on a mad chase across Europe until investigators witness him passing something to an elegantly dressed, very mysterious man. </p><p> When Milraud is caught and informs on his fellow conspirators, Liz finds herself embroiled in a larger, potentially explosive situation that twists all the way back to what she feared most-that the arms are being sold through the UK, and the mysterious man is closer and more capable of brutal violence than she ever could have imagined.</p></p><p><b>Dame Stella Rimington</b> joined the Security Service (MI5) in 1968.

At the beginning of this novel, she drives back to her family ranch in the foothills of the Sierras to attend the wedding of her identical twin, Judith, to a nice young doctor from Connecticut. Cassandra, however, is hell-bent on sabotaging the wedding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dorothy Baker's entrancing tragicomic novella follows an unpredictable course of events in which her heroine appears variously as conniving, self-aware, pitiful, frenzied, absurd, and heartbroken&#x2014;at once utterly impossible and tremendously sympathetic. Cassandra reckons with her complicated feelings about the sister who she feels owes it to her to be her alter ego; with her father, a brandy-soaked retired professor of philosophy; and with the ghost of her dead mother, as she struggles to come to terms with the only life she has.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First published in 1962, <i>Cassandra at the Wedding</i> is a book of enduring freshness, insight, and verve.

After graduating from UCLA , she traveled in France, where she began a novel and, in 1930, married the poet Howard Baker. The couple moved back to California, and Baker completed an MA in French, later teaching at a private school. After having a few short stories published, she turned to writing full time, despite, she would later claim, being &#x201c;seriously hampered by an abject admiration for Ernest Hemingway.&#x201d; In 1938, she published <i>Young Man with a Horn</i>, which was awarded the prestigious Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship Award. She received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1942 and, the next year, published Trio, a novel whose frank portrayal of a lesbian relationship proved too scandalous for the times; Baker and her husband adapted the novel as a play in 1944, but it was quickly shut down because of protests. Her final novel, <i>Cassandra at the Wedding</i>, examined the relationship between two exceptionally close sisters, whom Howard Baker asserted were based on both Baker herself and the couple&#x2019;s two daughters.

Wolpe blends the powerful personal story of his struggles with his own faith with a poignant response to the new atheists that reveals just how important faith in modern society. With a foreword by Rick Warren, <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of <em>The Purpose Driven Life, Why Faith Matters </em><em>is an </em>articulate and much-needed nondenominational defense of established religion in America by the man <em>Newsweek </em>magazine named the #1 Pulpit Rabbi in America.</p></p><p><p>Judging by today's bestseller lists, one would think that religion is either irrational or extreme. What's missing is a genuine debate between the atheists and fanatics; someone to point out that religion has value in the modern world. <em>Why Faith Matters</em> is an articulate defense of religion in America. It makes the case for faith and shows its relationship to history and science. Refuting the cold reason of the atheists and the hatred of the fanatics with a vision of religion informed by faith, love, and understanding, Rabbi David J. Wolpe follows in a literary tradition that stretches from Cardinal Newman to C. S. Lewis to Thomas Merton&#x2014;all individuals of faith who brought religion and culture together in their own works. Drawing on the personal and powerful story of his battle with cancer, Wolpe offers a moving statement in support of religion today. In a poignant response to the new atheists, Wolpe takes readers through the origins and nature of faith, the role of the Bible in modern life, and the compatibility of God and science. He concludes with a powerful argument for the place of God, faith, and religion in today's world.</p><p>Named the #1 Pulpit Rabbi in America (as reported in <em>Newsweek</em>), David J. Wolpe is the rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles and a teacher of modern Jewish religious thought at UCLA. Rabbi Wolpe writes for many publications, including <em>The Jewish Week</em>, <em>Jerusalem Post</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and Beliefnet.com.

She works intimately with computers--sentient and otherwise.In a detour from her first three outings featuring the delightful Meg Langslow (Revenge of the Wrought-Iron Flamingos, etc.), Andrews pulls her quirky new sleuth, Turing Hopper, from cyberspace. Turing, named for AI pioneer Alan Turing, is an AIP Artificial Intelligence Personality and the star of a vast number of research programs housed at Universal Library (UL) in Crystal City outside Washington, D.C. Turing's personalized banter with her customers is so down to earth she seems almost real, and she herself begins to believe she's becoming sentient. When her programmer, Zach Malone, mysteriously disappears, Turing suspects foul play and explores every avenue within her capabilities to find him. Needing human aid, she asks Tim Pincoski, UL's "Xeroxcist," and Maude Graham, secretary to a UL executive, for help. Programming an investigation takes Turing beyond her limited form and all three into corporate espionage, danger and murder. UL surveillance cameras are everywhere, and Turing's capacity to invade files and data in almost every area scarily evokes Big Brother. Without a doubt, this is a unique effort executed with great skill. The high-tech investigation, Turing's plan for herself and her ruminations about becoming almost human are sure to engage computer buffs everywhere. Fans looking for the lighthearted, humorous romps of the author's earlier books, however, may be disappointed. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Telling Tales: A Vera Stanhope Mystery (Vera Stanhope, 2)</h2><p><p><b>From Ann Cleeves, winner of the CWA Diamond Dagger Award, comes Telling Tales, an early book in the Vera Stanhope series, which has been brought to life by Brenda Blethyn in the hit TV series Vera.</b><br><b></b><br><b>&#x201c;I do love Vera!&#x201d; - Val McDermid</b><br><b></b><br>It has been ten years since Jeanie Long was charged with the murder of fifteen-year-old Abigail Mantel.

In the process, he takes us on a journey into the wild and the tame, the beautiful and the fragile.<br><br>Over the course of a full nesting season, Gessner immerses himself in the lives of these majestic birds. He observes their remarkable adaptability, their astonishing fish-catching skills, their housekeeping habits, and, when the chicks are born, both their savage and gentle ways of nurturing. For Gessner, spotting an osprey dive for fish at forty miles an hour becomes a lesson in patience and focus, watching the birds build their nests illustrates the vital task of making a home, and following the chicks' attempts to fly show him the value of letting go. He discovers the rewards of slowing down and the discipline of waiting and watching. And he witnesses an extraordinary event: the survival of ten young ospreys, the most his Cape Cod neighborhood has seen in more than half a century.<br><br><i>Return of the Osprey</i> is a story of a remarkable recovery, a celebration of place, and a thoughtful meditation on finding one's way in the world.</p><p>There was a time, not so long ago, when the osprey, or fish hawk, was a common sight along the New England shore. Taking up residence in tall trees that commanded a wide view of sea and sky, the osprey summered along the Atlantic coast, migrating far south to Brazil when the weather turned cold, returning north to nest year after year. That ancient cycle was cut short when DDT-based pesticides entered the ospreys' food chain and caused a perilous decline in their numbers. In time, thanks to the efforts of writer-conservationist Rachel Carson and the lawyers and scientists of the newly founded Environmental Defense Fund, the use of DDT was banned throughout the United States, but its effect on the ospreys endured long afterward.<p> David Gessner, an able chronicler of the natural world, here recounts the slow reintroduction of the fish hawk to Cape Cod. He offers learned but lightly spun information on their natural history and behavior, matching what he has read to what he has seen as a close observer of these birds in the wild. (He wryly notes, "Sometimes sitting out on the marsh for hours on end is simply boring"--but entirely necessary.) Gessner's memoir documents the fortunes of a single species and celebrates the virtues of committing to a single place, a commitment that, he writes, "the modern world works against." It's a welcome addition to the natural history of raptors and of New England alike. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>More than any other bird, the osprey symbolizes the New England coast, as Roger Tory Peterson once noted. Known also as fish hawks, ospreys-with their magnificent six-foot wingspans and dark masks-are the only raptors to dive fully into the water to catch their prey.<p> In <i>Return of the Osprey</i>, David Gessner sets himself on a quest: to watch these great birds of prey and learn about their astonishing comeback to the Atlantic coast after a twenty-year absence. Over the course of a full nesting season-from March, when the ospreys return from their wintering grounds, to September, when they migrate back to South America - Gessner immerses himself in the lives of four pairs of hawks.</p><p> By bike, by kayak, and on foot, he takes the reader through the beautiful landscape of Cape Cod and details the intricacies of the ospreys' day-to-day living: nest-building, courtship, giving birth, first flights, the murder of one fledgling by another, and, most captivating of all, the ospreys' swift and forceful dive into the sea. In the process, Gessner discovers an intimacy with the land and learns about resiliency and hope. And he witnesses an extra ordinary event: the survival of nine young ospreys, the most his town has seen in more than half a century. <i>Return of the Osprey</i> is the story of a remarkable recovery, a celebration of place, and a journey into the wild and the tame, the beautiful and the fragile.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Roman Empire (Make It Work!

Visit his website www.wordfire.comBestseller Anderson turns up the heat in his second Saga of the Seven Suns installment (after 2002's Hidden Empire), proving he has firepower to burn. He weaves action, romance and science with a rousing plot reflecting the classic SF of Clarke and Herbert and the glossy cinematic influence of Lucas and Spielberg. Five years after the events in Hidden Empire, hydrogues, gas giant aliens, continue to plague the Terran Hanseatic League in retaliation for the Hansa's "accidental" destruction of a hydrogue planet. This time they're also eager to destroy their ancient enemy, the Verdani, an interconnected, semi-sentient worldforest far more dangerous to the quicksilver aliens than mere humans ("The roots of a tree can shatter mountains, given time"). EDF (Earth Defense Forces) have hidden enemies in the Klikiss robots, whose resolve to reprogram "compies" (short for "Competent Computerized Companions") into human-killing robots is just as alarming as covert alien experiments on humans. Anderson's well-drawn cast includes spy Davin Lotze, an exosociologist who discovers a new method of space travel; earthy space-trader Rlinda Kett; King Peter, a reluctant "puppet" who challenges power-mad Basil Wenceslas; and DD, the terrified friendly compy kidnapped by a ruthless Klikiss robot. Sparked with surprises, enriched by ecological issues that laypersons can appreciate, this saga soars as it exposes the inner and external roots of war. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Class Act: William Haines Legendary Hollywood Decorator</h2><p>William Haines came to Hollywood after winning a new-talent contest in 1922.

In Anthony Burgess&#39; infamous nightmare vision of youth culture in revolt, fifteen-year-old Alex and his friends set out on a diabolical orgy of robbery, rape, torture and murder. Alex is jailed for his teenage delinquency and the State tries to reform him - but at what cost? Burgess writes of social prophecy and free will in this black comedy.</p><p>Anthony Burgess was born in Manchester in 1917. He studied English at Manchester University and joined the army in 1940 where he spent six years in the Education Corps. After demobilization, he worked first as a college lecturer in Speech and Drama and then as a grammar-school master before becoming an education officer in the Colonial Service, stationed in Malay and Borneo. In 1959 Burgess was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and decided to become a full-time writer. Despite being given less than a year to live, Burgess went on to write at least a book a year - including A Clockwork Orange (1962), M/F (1971), Man of Nazareth (1979), Earthly Powers (1980) and The Kingdom of the Wicked (1985) - and hundreds of book reviews right up until his death. He was also a prolific composer and produced many full-scale works for orchestra and other media during his lifetime. Anthony Burgess died in 1993.Anthony Burgess's 1963 novel was published with a glossary of the dystopian language used by Alex, the brutal teenage narrator. The quality of Tom Hollander's performance, however, renders such help unnecessary. Hollander's vocal suggestiveness, grasp of tone, and overall emotional resonance with the novel give listeners amazing clarity (especially if, like this reviewer, they've previously read the book relying on the glossary). You listen to Alex's adventures, amazed at the clarity Hollander gives to such a verbally ambitious work. This recording also includes the last chapter of the novel (not published in the first American edition), Burgess's later introduction to the book, and, from the Caedmon archives, Burgess himself reading excerpts.

Retold by the famous American poet and writer Sidney Lanier, the stories are adapted from Sir Thomas Malory's <i>Le Morte d'Arthur, </i>written in the15th century. The tales are told in the style and language of the original.<br> Readers will thrill to the glorious adventures of Arthur and his knights: the mysterious birth of Arthur, how Arthur pulled the sword from the stone to become King of England, Sir Percival's search for the Holy Grail, the tragic romance of Tristram and Isolde, Launcelot's gallant battle to save Queen Guenevere from a death sentence, and Arthur's final struggle with the evil Sir Mordred.<br> These stories capture the age-old drama and romance surrounding the fabled king and his followers, all sworn to uphold lofty ideals of courage, honesty, loyalty, and devotion. This inexpensive volume invites a new generation of readers to enjoy these time-honored tales of gallant knights and fair ladies.<br> These stories have inspired numerous film adaptations, including the 2017 release <i>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</i>, directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Eric Bana, Djimon Hounsou, and Annabelle Wallis.</p><p>Sidney Lanier (1842-1881) was born in Macon, Georgia. After serving in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, he held a variety of jobs and traveled widely throughout the northern and southern states. In addition to earning success as a poet, Lanier received praise as a professional flutist with the Peabody Symphony Orchestra in Baltimore before he died of tuberculosis in 1881.<br><br>Scholars have determined that there were at least six Thomas Malorys alive in the 1400s when Le Morte d'Arthur was written. Considerable evidence points to the likeliest author as one Sir Thomas Malory or Maleore of Newbold Revell in Warwickshire, who was born in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. A member of the gentry, he became a soldier in the service of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, with whom he fought in the siege of Calais in 1436. In records of the period he is accused of various crimes--including armed robbery, attempted murder, and rape--and he is said to have executed several dramatic escapes from prison. <br>Several things about Malory seem indisputable. As in Arthur's time when post-Roman Britain was in a state of fierce tribal war, he lived in an age of great unrest. Europe was still recovering from the Black Plague and a century of war. In England, two powerful families fought for the throne. Although he may have been a scoundrel, Malory was also, it seems clear, a man of ideals who believed in courage and loyalty, and who mourned the passing of chivalry. Incarcerated for long periods, he had many hours to fill his imagination with French romances and tales of chivalry, volumes of which were readily at hand. It is thought that Le Morte d'Arthur was written during his imprisonment. <br>Malory referred to himself as a 'knight-prisoner.' With a military man's passion for the details of conquest, a prisoner's sense of injustice, and a penitent's desire for redemption, he dedicated himself wholeheartedly to this retelling of the Arthurian legends. Sir Thomas Malory died, it is presumed, around 1471.</p><h2>Fist of God</h2><p>During the Gulf War, a mysterious spy planted deep in the heart of Iraq becomes the key as Saddam Hussein threatens to unleash a secret, ultimate weapon on the Allied forces.

Now, 30 years later, he has completely rewritten and updated his earlier book to provide fresh evidence to support his original argument. <b>The Shroud</b> boldly challenges the current post-radiocarbon dating view -- that it is a fake. By arguing his case brilliantly and provocatively, Ian Wilson once more throws the matter into the public arena for further debate and controversy.</p><p>IAN WILSON is a prolific, internationally published author specialising in historical and religious mysteries. Born in south London, he graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford University, in 1963 with honours in Modern History. The TV documentary that he co-scripted to accompany his 1978 Shroud book won a BAFTA award.

With the likely disappearance of celluloid film stock as a medium, and the emergence of new media competing for an audience, what will happen to cinema--and to cinema studies? In the first of two books exploring this question, D. N. Rodowick considers the fate of film and its role in the aesthetics and culture of moviemaking and viewing in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Here Rodowick proposes and examines three different critical responses to the disappearance of film in relation to other time-based media, and to the study of contemporary visual culture. Film, he suggests, occupies a special place in the genealogy of the arts of the virtual: while film disappears, cinema persists--at least in the narrative forms imagined by Hollywood since 1915. Rodowick also observes that most so-called "new media" are fashioned upon a cinematic metaphor. His book helps us see how digital technologies are serving, like television and video before them, to perpetuate the cinematic as the mature audiovisual culture of the twentieth century--and, at the same time, how they are preparing the emergence of a new audiovisual culture whose broad outlines we are only just beginning to distinguish.</p></p><p>D. N. Rodowick is Glen A. Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago.&#x201c;Lucid and forceful, D.N. Rodowick persuasively argues for the enduring relevance of film theory in an age in which film, itself, has been enhanced, extended, and transformed by new media platforms and forms. Skeptical and dialectical, this profound and graceful meditation reconsiders the photographic ontology of cinema and concepts such as "medium," "virtuality," and "automatism"&#x2015;its aim not only the preservation and expansion of film studies as a humanities discipline but also a recuperation of the important philosophical questions that have been foundational for film theory. This is "must" reading for anyone interested in understanding the nature and experience of the moving image.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Vivian Sobchack, Professor of Film, Television and Digital Media, University of California, Los Angeles</b><br><br>&#x201c;Calmly, intrepidly, Rodowick dives straight into the churning waters of <i>The Virtual Life of Film</i>. Just as cinema anchors new media, so film theory anchors these philosophical speculations that dare to imagine the digital untethered. Neither apocalyptic nor nostalgic, Rodowick appears equipoised as he explores what's behind and in front of this brave new media world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Dudley Andrew, R. Selden Rose Professor of Film and Comparative Literature, Yale University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Over the years Rodowick has provided perhaps the most thorough readings and evaluations of contemporary, post-classical film theory any scholar has offered. <i>The Virtual Life of Film</i> offers his speculations about cinema's digital transformation.

In this lively history of bakers, dietary crusaders, and social reformers, Aaron Bobrow-Strain shows us that what we think about the humble, puffy loaf says a lot about who we are and what we want our society to look like.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>White Bread</i> teaches us that when Americans debate what one should eat, they are also wrestling with larger questions of race, class, immigration, and gender. As Bobrow-Strain traces the story of bread, from the first factory loaf to the latest gourmet <i>pain au levain,</i> he shows how efforts to champion &#x201c;good food&#x201d; reflect dreams of a better society&#x2014;even as they reinforce stark social hierarchies.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the early twentieth century, the factory-baked loaf heralded a bright new future, a world away from the hot, dusty, &#x201c;dirty&#x201d; bakeries run by immigrants. Fortified with vitamins, this bread was considered the original &#x201c;superfood&#x201d; and even marketed as patriotic&#x2014;while food reformers painted white bread as a symbol of all that was wrong with America.<br> &nbsp;<br> The history of America&#x2019;s one-hundred-year-long love-hate relationship with white bread reveals a lot about contemporary efforts to change the way we eat. Today, the alternative food movement favors foods deemed ethical and environmentally correct to eat, and fluffy industrial loaves are about as far from slow, local, and organic as you can get. Still, the beliefs of early twentieth-century food experts and diet gurus, that getting people to eat a certain food could restore the nation&#x2019;s decaying physical, moral, and social fabric, will sound surprisingly familiar. Given that open disdain for &#x201c;unhealthy&#x201d; eaters and discrimination on the basis of eating habits grow increasingly acceptable, <i>White Bread</i> is a timely and important examination of what we talk about when we talk about food.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012</strong>: It's in, it's out, it's good for you, it's bad for you: over the last hundred years, bread has gone from industrial-strength cure-all to nutritionless fluff, and every place in between. <i>White Bread</i> is Aaron Bobrow-Strain's look at the central place of bread, not just on the American table but also in its discussions about morality, class, race, and the environment. Bobrow-Strain takes readers from the immigrant-run bakeries of the 1900s, which were associated with unsafe bread, to the shining promise of industrially-made loaves that could bolster Americans against communism, to the brown-bread revolution of the '70s and '80s. Along the way, Bobrow-Strain shows that the history of bread was leavened with good intentions and ironclad convictions--many of which succumbed to the ageless hobgoblin of unintended consequences. Entertaining for fans of history, food, and the history of food, <i>White Bread</i> reveals yet another facet to the ever-complicated world of what we eat. <i>--Darryl Campbell</i><p><b>Aaron Bobrow-Strain</b> is associate professor of politics at Whitman College in Washington.

Now, with this #1 <b>New York Times</b> bestselling novel, she outdoes herself, with a wry tale of life and turmoil behind the blue wall.</p><p>Chaos breaks loose when the governor of Virginia orders that speed traps be painted on all streets and highways, and warns that speeders will be caught by monitoring aircraft flying overhead. But the eccentric island of Tangier, fourteen miles off the coast of Virginia in Chesapeake Bay, responds by declaring war on its own state. Judy Hammer, newly installed as the superintendent of the Virginia State Police, and Andy Brazil, a state trooper and Hammer&#x2019;s right hand and confidant, find themselves at their wits&#x2019; end as they try to protect the public from the politicians&#x2014;and vice versa&#x2014;in this pitch-perfect, darkly comic romp.</p></p><p>Be aware: this is not your typical Patricia Cornwell novel. Not only is there no Kay Scarpetta, but <i>Isle of Dogs</i> is a comic romp, a real departure for this author. It does center around a couple of characters from past books--police chief Judy Hammer and reporter-turned-cop Andy Brazil of <i>Hornet's Nest</i> and <i>Southern Cross</i>. But the plot, style, and tone will remind you more of Carl Hiaasen's dark comedies.<p> The madcap doings get underway when the addled, nearly blind governor of Virginia confusedly launches a speed-trap program on isolated Tangier Island, whose prickly, eccentric residents promptly attempt secession. Cornwell adeptly interweaves other crisscrossing plot lines involving a gang of street-stupid thugs gunning for Hammer and Brazil, an angel-faced serial killer, a kidnapped dog, and more. She does miss a few beats: the pacing sags during certain episodes, and at times the writing strains so hard for laughs that instead it draws winces. Nonetheless, <i>Isle of Dogs</i> is for the most part a funny, diverting read and a refreshing departure for Cornwell. <i>--Nicholas H.

So begins the fascinating and often surprising story of the Homestead Grays, the Negro League's most successful franchise, and how the fight to integrate baseball began not in Brooklyn with Jackie Robinson but in our nation's capital. </p><p>During the first half of the twentieth century, Washington, D.C., was a segregated Southern town. Black and white Washingtonians lived in separate worlds--until those worlds collided at Griffith Stadium. Standing in the heart of a thriving black district, the park played host to the white Washington Senators and, when the Senators were out of town, the Homestead Grays. There, the best team in the Negro Leagues reigned victorious on the same field where one of the worst teams in the all-white majors struck out again and again. Although white fans never caught on, tens of thousands of loyal black fans flocked to watch the great Grays. On those sun-bright stadium afternoons, the wall of segregation fell away; the fans sat wherever they wanted--and, together with their number-one team and a host of heroes, they transformed our nation's capital into the front lines of the campaign to integrate major-league baseball. </p><p>In this transcendent account, the author gracefully unfolds the true story behind this bold adventure, taking you back to those front lines, where intriguing characters such as journalists Sam Lacy and Wendell Smith fought doggedly for integration; the Negro Leagues' most celebrated sluggers, Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard, gave the major-league superstars a run for their money; and club owner Clark Griffith, mired in prejudice and greed, thwarted integration at every turn. Through numerous interviews with key players (many now deceased), a treasure trove of archival material, and dozens of unpublished historical photos, the author masterfully pieces together the lost legend of how the fight to integrate baseball really began, bearing witness at last to the greatest legends of black baseball and opening the book on a forgotten chapter in American history. </p><p>"This is the story of the lost era between the Babe and Jackie, of a crusading journalist named Sam Lacy, an immensely talented black ballplayer named Buck Leonard, and a stubborn major league owner named Clark Griffith. It's the story of why the fight to integrate major league baseball began in Washington and not in Brooklyn, why black Washington ultimately lost the fight, and why the Senators were not the first team to integrate. And it's the story of the greatest baseball dynasty that most people have never heard of, the Homestead Grays, whose wartime popularity at Griffith Stadium moved them beyond the shadow of the Senators."<br>--from the Introduction </p><p>So begins this powerful and passionate account of how the fight to integrate baseball really began. Moving seamlessly between the heroic exploits of the ballfield and the exploitation of the boardroom, <i>Beyond the Shadow of the Senators</i> reveals all the magic and madness that surrounded the legendary Homestead Grays and their lesser--but more recognized--stadium-mates, the Washington Senators. </p><p>Drawing on extensive interviews with key players, long-lost archives, and dozens of dazzling historical photos, the author meticulously chronicles the true story behind this forgotten chapter in the annals of baseball, painting a portrait of larger-than-life characters and lazy, golden afternoons you'll wish you could remember--when the Homestead Grays dominated Griffith Stadium and gave baseball's white superstars a run for their money.</p><p><b>Brad Snyder's</b> articles on baseball and other subjects have appeared in numerous publications including the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, and the <i>St. Petersburg Times</i>.

I originally put it together as a class assignment at the University of Oklahoma&#x2019;s Professional Writing program, more than two years before <i>Storm Front</i> found a home at Roc.</p><p>This one won&#x2019;t win any awards, because it is, quite frankly, a novice effort. It was perhaps the third or fourth short story I&#x2019;d ever written, if you include projects in grade school. I had barely learned to keep my feet under me as a writer, and to some degree that shows in this piece. Certainly, the editors to whom I submitted this story seemed to think it wasn&#x2019;t up to par for professional publication, and I think that was a perfectly fair assessment.</p><p>Read this story for what it is&#x2014;an anxious beginner&#x2019;s first effort, meant to be simple, straightforward fun.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><br>------------------------------<br><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>I</b> struggled to hold on to the yowling child while fumbling a quarter into the pay phone and jamming down the buttons to dial Nick&#x2019;s mobile.</p><p>&#x201c;Ragged Angel Investigations,&#x201d; Nick answered. His voice was tense, I thought, anxious.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Harry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You can relax, man. I found her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You did?&#x201d; Nick asked. He let out a long exhalation. &#x201c;Oh, Jesus, Harry.&#x201d;</p><p>The kid lifted up one of her oxford shoes and mule-kicked her leg back at my shin. She connected, hard enough to make me jump. She looked like a parent&#x2019;s dream at eight or nine years old, with her dimples and dark pigtails&#x2014;even in her street-stained schoolgirl&#x2019;s uniform. And she had strong legs.</p><p>I got a better hold on the girl and lifted her up off the ground again while she twisted and wriggled. &#x201c;Ow. Hold still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me go, beanpole,&#x201d; she responded, turning to glower back at me before starting to kick again.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen to me, Harry,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to let the kid go right this minute and walk away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Nick, the Astors are going to give us twenty-five grand to return her before nine p.m.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got some bad news, Harry. They aren&#x2019;t going to pay us the money.&#x201d;</p><p>I winced. &#x201c;Ouch. Maybe I should just drop her off at the nearest precinct house, then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The news gets worse. The parents reported the girl kidnapped. The police band is sending two descriptions around town to Chicago PD, and they match guess who.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mickey and Donald?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Heh,&#x201d; Nick said. I heard him flick his Bic and take a drag. &#x201c;We should be so lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s more embarrassing for Mr. and Mrs. High-and-Mighty to have their kid run away than it is to have her kidnapped.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hell. Kidnapped girl gives them something to talk about at their parties for months. Makes them look richer and more famous than their friends, too. Of course, we&#x2019;ll be in jail, but what the hell?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They came to us,&#x201d; I protested.</p><p>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t be the way they tell it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dammit,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;If you get caught with her, it could be trouble for both of us. The Astors got connections. Ditch the girl and get back home. You were there all night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Nick,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let the boys in blue bring her in. That&#x2019;ll clear you and me both.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m up on North Avenue, and it&#x2019;s after dark. I&#x2019;m not leaving a nine-year-old girl out here by herself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten,&#x201d; shouted the girl, furious. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ten, you insensitive jerk!&#x201d; She started kicking again, and I kept myself more or less out of the way of her feet.</p><p>&#x201c;She sounds so cute. Just let her run, Harry, and let the criminal types beware.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aw, hell, Harry. You&#x2019;re getting moral on me again.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled, but it felt tight on my mouth, and my stomach churned with anger. &#x201c;Look, we&#x2019;ll think of something. Just get down here and pick us up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What happened to your car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Broke down this afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Again? What about the El?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m broke. Nick, I need a ride. I can&#x2019;t walk back to the office with her, and I don&#x2019;t want to stand here in a public booth fighting her, either. So get down here and get us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to spend time in jail because you can&#x2019;t salve your conscience, Harry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about your conscience?&#x201d; I shot back. Nick was all bluster. When it came down to the wire, he couldn&#x2019;t have left the girl alone in that part of town, either.</p><p>Nick growled out something that sounded vaguely obscene, then said, &#x201c;Fine, whatever. But I can&#x2019;t get across the river very easy, so I&#x2019;ll be on the far side of the bridge. All you have to do is cross the bridge with her and stay out of sight. Police patrols in the area will be looking for you. Half an hour. If you&#x2019;re not there, I&#x2019;m not waiting. Bad neighborhood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have faith, man. I&#x2019;ll be there.&#x201d;</p><p>We hung up without saying good-bye.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, kid,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Stop kicking me and let&#x2019;s talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To hell with you, mister,&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Let me go before I break your leg.&#x201d;</p><p>I winced at the shrill note her voice hit and stepped away from the phone, half dragging and half carrying her with me while I looked around nervously. The last thing I needed was a bunch of good citizens running to the kid&#x2019;s aid.</p><p>The streets were empty, the gathering dark rushing in quickly to fill the spaces left by the broken streetlights. There were lights in the windows, but no one came out in response to the girl&#x2019;s shouting. It was the sort of neighborhood where people looked the other way and let live.</p><p>Ah, Chicago. You just gotta love big, sprawling American cities. Ain&#x2019;t modern living grand? I could have been a real sicko, rather than just looking like one, and no one would have done anything.</p><p>It made me feel a little nauseated. &#x201c;Look. I know you&#x2019;re angry right now, but believe me, I&#x2019;m doing what&#x2019;s best for you.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped kicking and glared up at me. &#x201c;How should you know what&#x2019;s best for me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m older than you. Wiser.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why are you wearing that coat?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at my big black duster, with its heavy mantle and long canvas folds flapping around my rather spare frame. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It belongs on the set of <i>El Dorado</i>,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;Who are you supposed to be, Ichabod Crane or the Marlboro Man?&#x201d;</p><p>I snorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a wizard.&#x201d;</p><p>She gave me a look of skepticism you can really only get from children who have recently gone through the sobering trauma of discovering there is no Santa Claus. (Ironically, there is, but he can&#x2019;t operate on the sort of scale that used to make everyone believe in him.)</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;I found you, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>She frowned at me. &#x201c;How did you find me? I thought that spot was perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>I continued walking toward the bridge. &#x201c;It would have been, for another ten minutes or so. Then that Dumpster would have been full of rats looking for something to eat.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl&#x2019;s expression turned faintly green. &#x201c;Rats?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. With luck, maybe I could win the kid over. &#x201c;Good thing your mother had your brush in her purse. I was able to get a couple of hairs from it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed. &#x201c;So, I used a little thaumaturgy, and it led me straight to you. I had to walk most of the way, but straight to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thauma-what?&#x201d;</p><p>Questions were better than kicks any day. I kept answering them. Heck, I like to answer questions about magic. Professional pride, maybe. &#x201c;Thaumaturgy. It&#x2019;s ritual magic. You draw symbolic links between actual persons, places, or events, and representative models. Then you invest a little energy to make something happen on the small scale, and something happens on the large scale as well&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The second I was distracted with answering her question, the kid bent her head and bit my hand.</p><p>I yelled something I probably shouldn&#x2019;t have around a kid and jerked my hand away. The kid dropped to the ground, agile as a monkey, and took off toward the bridge. I shook my hand, growled at myself, and took off after her. She was fast, her pigtails flying out behind her, her shoes and stained kneesocks flashing.</p><p>She got to the bridge first. It was an ancient, two-lane affair that arched over the Chicago River. She hurled herself out onto it.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; I shouted after her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t know this town like I did.</p><p>&#x201c;Sucker,&#x201d; she called back, her voice merry. She kept on running.</p><p>That is, until a great rubbery, hairy arm slithered out from beneath a manhole cover at the apex of the bridge and wrapped its greasy fingers around one of her ankles. The kid screamed in sudden terror, pitching forward onto the asphalt and raking the skin from both knees. She turned and twisted, kicking at her attacker. Blood was a dark stain on her socks in the glow of the few functioning streetlights.</p><p>I cursed beneath my breath and raced toward her along the bridge, my lungs laboring. The hand tightened its grip and started dragging her toward the manhole. I could hear deep, growling laughter coming from the darkness in the hole that led down to the understructure of the bridge.</p><p>She screamed, &#x201c;What is it? What is it? Make it let go!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Kid!&#x201d; I shouted. I ran toward the manhole, jumped, and came down as hard as I could on the hairy arm, right at the wrist, the heels of both hiking boots thumping down onto the grimy flesh.</p><p>A bellow erupted from the manhole, and the fingers loosened. The girl twisted her leg, and though it cost her one of her expensive oxfords and one kneesock, she dragged herself free of its grasp, sobbing. I gathered her up and backpedaled away, turning so that I wasn&#x2019;t leaving my back to the manhole.</p><p>The troll shouldn&#x2019;t have been able to squeeze his way out of a hole that small, but he d...</p></p><h2>Guide to Money &amp; Investing</h2><p>Basic wear and tear.

We assume things are going to go a certain way. And when they don&#39;t, we find ourselves in a new place---a place we haven&#39;t been before, a place we never would have imagined on our own. It is the difficult and the unexpected, and maybe even the tragic, that opens us up and frees us to see things in new ways. Many of the most significant moments in our lives come not because it all went right but because it all fell apart. Suffering does that. It hurts, but it also creates. This book is an exploration of the complex relationship between suffering and creativity, driven by the belief that there is art in the agony.</p><p>Rob Bell lives with his family in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he&#39;s the founding pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church.

Es graduado de la Universidad de Wheaton en Illinois y tiene una maestria en divinidad del Seminario Teologico Fuller en Pasadena, California. Rob es autor de Una obra de arte original, Sexo Dios y Jesus quiere salvar a los cristianos, entre otros. Tambien aparece en la primera serie de peliculas cortas a la que se ha denominado NOOMA. Rob y su esposa, Kristen, tienen tres hijos y residen en Grand Rapids, Michigan.While Bell's books <i>Velvet Elvis</i> and <i>Sex God</i> received generally strong reviews, this effort to understand the relationship between suffering and creativity feels superficial and overly self-conscious. Few readers will dispute Bell's gentle assertions: that life can be extremely difficult and capricious, that it is often difficult to find God amid suffering, that suffering has a great potential to unify disparate people, and that great bursts of creative energy can arise from pain. Bell explores these issues not by covert biblical exegesis&#x2014;which was a surprising and welcome highlight of <i>Velvet Elvis</i>&#x2014;but new-fashioned storytelling. Bell weaves inspiring stories of people who turned their suffering into something transformative, and many of these stories are memorable. They are certainly accessible: Bell draws from fiction, movies, real-life situations and his own life. These anecdotes do not make a book, however, and Bell's spare prose lacks original insights into age-old theodicy questions. Although the design and layout are first-rate, $35 is a lot of money for a 160-page book that is mostly white space. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ukrainian nationalists see themselves as one of the world&#x2019;s oldest and most civilized peoples, as older brothers&#x201d; to the younger Russian culture.Yet Ukraine became independent only in 1991, and Ukrainians often feel like a minority in their own country, where Russian is still the main language heard on the streets of the capital, Kiev. This book is a comprehensive guide to modern Ukraine and to the versions of its past propagated by both Russians and Ukrainians. Andrew Wilson provides the most acute, informed, and up-to-date account available of the Ukrainians and their country.<br><br>Concentrating on the complex relation between Ukraine and Russia, the book begins with the myth of common origin in the early medieval era, then looks closely at the Ukrainian experience under the tsars and Soviets, the experience of minorities in the country, and the path to independence in 1991. Wilson also considers the history of Ukraine since 1991 and the continuing disputes over identity, culture, and religion. He examines the economic collapse under the first president, Leonid Kravchuk, and the attempts at recovery under his successor, Leonid Kuchma. Wilson explores the conflicts in Ukrainian society between the country&#x2019;s Eurasian roots and its Western aspirations, as well as the significance of the presidential election of November 1999.<br></p><p><b>Andrew Wilson</b> is lecturer in Ukrainian studies at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College, London.<br>Since the 1990s, journalists, academics, politicians and the public have groped for some sense of the history, culture and politics of emerging, post-communist independent statesACroatia, Macedonia, Slovakia, Belarus, Slovenia and the like. In 1991 Ukraine joined the ranks of these new states and emerged as a pivotal player in the new alignment of Eurasian politics. Wilson, a lecturer in Ukrainian studies at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies of University College in London, provides a comprehensive overview (more scholarly than popular) of Ukraine's history, focusing on questions of national identity and describing Ukraine as a recent invention as a nation. For Ukraine, he suggests, national identity revolves around the complex and fluctuating relation between Ukraine and Russia, from the contested views of medieval Kievan Rus and its national origins (Ukrainian or Russian or both?), to the troubles faced by a modern Ukraine with a significant Russian and Russian-speaking population. Wilson presents Ukraine as a cultural construct, a creation of both Ukrainian and Russian imagination and politics; as a result, the book will displease those who dismiss poststructuralist views of national identity. Still, thorough, rigorous and informative, Wilson's survey promises to sharpen Westerners' perceptions of the surviving East-West divide along the European and Russian border. Because it is "a vital 'swing' state" in Eastern Europe, Ukraine's past and future, Wilson convincingly argues, should very much concern us. Illus. not seen by PW.

With snatches of insight and glimpses of grace, Footprints Of A Pilgrim tells the story of a life (a very full and special life) complete with memories of joy, pain, brokenness, and healing. Also included are many never before published pictures which illustrate the remarkable journey of Ruth Bell Graham, as a child of a missionaries in Quingjiang, China in 1920, until today at her home in Little Piney Cove, Montreat, North Carolina.</p></p><p>"I love the paint of words...." So begins a poem by Ruth Bell Graham, best known as the wife of popular evangelist Billy Graham. Although poetry is at the heart of this beautifully laid-out "scrapbook" of her life, there's much more here in the way of Graham memorabilia: antique photos, plaintive journal entries, childhood drawings, love letters, and old college schedules: <blockquote> I can't remember when I wasn't scribbling something. I jot things down when I can't sleep or I'm too tired or I need to reflect on friends family, frustrations. Funny moments, notebook upon notebook, a storehouse of memories...</blockquote> Like Graham herself, there's plenty of humor here, and just a spark of mischief: whether it's her memories of breaking curfew in college and getting grounded ("I found I had plenty of time to write"), or her thoughts on marriage ("Divorce never... murder maybe"). <p> Peppered throughout are short, boxed vignettes about Ruth written by her children, her husband, one-time neighbor and crime novelist Patricia Cornwell, author Jan Karon, and former First Lady Barbara Bush. By turns poignant, humorous, and wistful, this scrapbook memoir is a fitting salute to an admired personality. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p><b>Ruth Bell Graham</b> (1920-2007) was a mother, a grandmother, a great-grandmother, and the wife of well-known evangelist Billy Graham.

These are places of sanctuary, even redemption---and Jeremy Mercer has found both amid the stacks of Shakespeare &amp; Co."<br>---Paul Collins, author of <i>Sixpence House: Lost in a Town of Books</i><br> <br>In a small square on the left bank of the Seine, the door to a green-fronted bookshop beckoned. . . .<br><br>With gangsters on his tail and his meager savings in hand, crime reporter Jeremy Mercer fled Canada in 1999 and ended up in Paris. Broke and almost homeless, he found himself invited to a tea party amongst the riffraff of the timeless Left Bank fantasy known as Shakespeare &amp; Co. In its present incarnation, Shakespeare &amp; Co. has become a destination for writers and readers the world over, trying to reclaim the lost world of literary Paris in the 1920s. Having been inspired by Sylvia Beach's original store, the present owner, George Whitman, invites writers who are down and out in Paris to live and dream amid the bookshelves in return for work. Jeremy Mercer tumbled into this literary rabbit hole and found a life of camaraderie with the other eccentric residents, and became, for a time, George Whitman's confidante and right-hand man. <br><br><i>Time Was Soft There</i> is one of the great stories of bohemian Paris and recalls the work of many writers who were bewitched by the City of Light in their youth. Jeremy's comrades include Simon, the eccentric British poet who refuses to give up his bed in the antiquarian book room, beautiful blonde Pia, who contributes the elegant spirit of Parisian couture to the store, the handsome American Kurt, who flirts with beautiful women looking for copies of <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>, and George himself, the man who holds the key to it all. As <i>Time Was Soft There</i> winds in and around the streets of Paris, the staff fall in and out of love, straighten bookshelves, host tea parties, drink in the more down-at-the-heels caf�s, sell a few books, and help George find a way to keep his endangered bookstore open. Spend a few days with Jeremy Mercer at 37 Rue de la Bucherie, and discover the bohemian world of Paris that still bustles in the shadow of Notre Dame.<br> <br>"Jeremy Mercer has captured Shakespeare &amp; Co. and its complicated owner, George Whitman, with remarkable insight. <i>Time Was Soft There</i> is a charming memoir about living in Whitman's Shakespeare &amp; Co. and the strange, broken, lost, and occasionally talented, eccentrics and residents of this Tumblewood Hotel."<br>---Noel Riley Fitch, author of <i>Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation: A History of Literary Paris in the Twenties &amp; Thirties</i> <br><br>"There does seem to be something about the odd ducks that work at bookstores. Jeremy Mercer has captured the story of a wonderful, unique store that could only be born out of a love for books and the written word."<br>--- Liz Schlegel, the Book Revue bookshop, Huntington, New York<br></p><p>Jeremy Mercer was formerly a journalist for the <i>Ottowa Citizen. </i>He is the author of two crime books and a founder of <i>Kilometer Zero,</i> a cult literary magazine currently being published out of Shakespeare &amp; Co.<br><br>Time Was Soft There<br>1.It was a gray winter Sunday when I came to the bookstore.As had been my habit during that troubled time, I was out walking. There was never a specific destination, merely an accumulation of random turns and city blocks to numb the hours and distract from the problems at hand. It was surprisingly easy to forget oneself among the bustling markets and grand boulevards, the manicured parks and marble monuments.On this particular day, a thin drizzle had begun falling early in the afternoon. At first, it was barely enough to wet the wool of a sweater, let alone interrupt this serious business of walking. But later, toward dusk, the skies abruptly thundered and opened into a downpour. Shelter was needed, and from where I'd been caught near the cathedral of Notre Dame, the yellow-and-green shop sign could just be glimpsed on the other side of the river.By then, I'd been in Paris a month, long enough to hear vague rumors about the legendary bookstore. I'd been intrigued, of course, and had often meant to visit. Yet as I crossed the bridge, with the wind whipping at my pant legs and umbrellas sprouting around me, these rumors were far from mind. My only thought was to escape the storm and idle the rainy minutes away.Out in front of the store, a tour group bravely posed for one last round of photographs. They used thick guidebooks to shield their cameras and their teeth were clenched into chattering smiles. Onewoman glared from beneath the hood of a rain slicker as her husband twisted a complicated lens. "Hurry," she urged. "Just hurry."Through the fog of the shop's main window, there could be seen a blur of warm light and moving bodies. To the left stood a narrow wooden door, its green paint wrinkled and chipped. With a faint creak, it swung open to reveal a modest delirium.A glittering chandelier hung from a cracked wooden ceiling beam, while in the corner an obese man squeezed rainwater from his turquoise muumuu. A horde of customers circled the desk, clamoring for the clerk's attention in a loud mash of languages. And the books. The books were everywhere. They sagged from wooden shelves, spilled from cardboard boxes, teetered in tall piles on tables and chairs. Stretched along the windowsill and taking in this mad scene was a silky black cat. I swear it looked up at me and winked.There was a sudden spray of wind as the tour group pushed inside the store. I was bounced forward, past the crowded desk, then up two stone stairs painted with the words LIVE FOR HUMANITY and through into a large central room. Here, tables and shelves overflowed with more books, two doorways led deeper into the store, and a murky skylight was set overhead. Most unusual was what this skylight cast down upon: an iron-rimmed wishing well, where a man on bended knee was clawing out coins of high denomination. As I approached, he glared up at me and quickly shielded his bounty with a crooked arm.Giving this fellow wide berth, I entered a narrow passage and found myself surrounded by books written in what appeared to be Russian. A wrong turn took me down a dead end to a sink surrounded by stacks of yellowed nature magazines. There was a soapy razor lying on an issue featuring the jungles of Madagascar. A dab of foam added an unnatural spot to a reclining leopard.Backing up, I arrived at a wall of German novels, then, stumbling slightly, there was another turn and a loose pyramid of glossy-covered art books. To one side was a stained-glass alcove with a bare bulb flickering inside. A woman was crouched there, muttering in Italian and trying to decipher the book titles in this shaky light.Finally, after stepping through another doorway, I was back in the room with the wishing well. The man who plunged his hand in the coins had vanished, but now the tour group had surged ahead and laid claim to the space. Half-blinded by flashing cameras, I was jostled among wet shoulders as they herded past me and into the very labyrinth from which I'd just emerged.It was at this juncture that I decided a caf� would be a calmer harbor from the storm. Making a cautious retreat past the clerk and the winking black cat, I went back out the green door. The sting of rain made me pause to reconsider, and as I stood huddled in the doorway, I noticed a wooden bookcase drilled into the wall beside the store window. The paperbacks were damp and bloated, but they cost just twenty-five francs, a sum even I could afford in those desperate days. A copy of <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> edged out at me. Guessing it would be an inexpensive way to swallow time, I ventured back inside.When it came my turn to be served, the young woman at the desk gave me a bright smile and folded open the cover of my book. With meticulous care, she stamped the title page with the crest of the Shakespeare and Company bookstore. Then she invited me upstairs for tea.TIME WAS SOFT THERE. Copyright � 2005 by Jeremy Mercer.

A devastatingly imaginative observer of the West's encounter with the East, he is the author of four highly acclaimed novels: <em>The Sheltering Sky</em>, <em>Let It Come Down</em>, <em>The Spider's House</em>, and <em>Up Above the World</em>. In addition to being one of the most powerful postwar American novelists, Bowles was an acclaimed composer, a travel writer, a poet, a translator, and a short-story writer.

I'd been obsessed with <em>Nancy Drew</em> mystery novels, and I was convinced that I, too, could be a spunky girl detective and track down all the dangerous criminals lurking in my suburban San Diego neighborhood. The fingerprint kit consisted of a brush and a baggie of black powder. I practiced by dusting various surfaces in my house, blowing off the excess powder, and using Scotch tape to capture the patterns. I never nabbed any dangerous criminals, but I did discover the interesting fact that fingerprint powder is <em>really </em>hard to clean off white walls and furniture.</p> <p>Thus ended my career as spunky girl detective.</p> <p>The years passed and I grew up to become a doctor and then a thriller novelist, but I never forgot my childhood fantasy of being a crime-fighter. I realize now that it was a variation of a universal fantasy we all share: that even ordinary people can do extraordinary things. It's a theme we see often in fiction and in movies: Harry Potter, the despised boy living under the stairs, becomes the world's greatest wizard. Luke Skywalker, a farm boy, becomes a Jedi knight. So why <em>couldn't</em> a mere kid help catch a criminal?</p> <p>In my newest novel <em>Last to Die</em>, that's exactly what happens.</p> <p>It's the tenth in my <em>Rizzoli and Isles</em> crime series starring homicide detective Jane Rizzoli and medical examiner Maura Isles. This time they're on the hunt for a killer who's stalking three surviving orphans of different family massacres. Assisting Jane and Maura are a few brilliant young sleuths who belong to The Jackals, a student forensics club at the remote and mysterious Evensong boarding school. The three threatened orphans--Claire, Will, and Teddy--are now sheltered at Evensong, where frightening new events at the school make Jane Rizzoli wonder if the killer has tracked the orphans to the isolated sanctuary that was supposed to keep them safe.</p> <p>But Evensong is no ordinary school, and Evensong's students are certainly not ordinary children. Among the students is sixteen-year-old Julian "Rat" Perkins, who saved Maura's life in my book <em>Ice Cold</em>. &nbsp;As president of The Jackals Club, Julian leads this oddball group of amateur detectives, and they have more than a few tricks up their sleeves--tricks that may save the lives of Jane and Maura.</p> <p>I never fulfilled my childhood fantasy of being a girl sleuth who catches bad guys. But I can finally bring that fantasy to life in <em>Last to Die, </em>where it just might be the kids who bring down the killer.</p><b>Tess Gerritsen</b> is a physician and an internationally bestselling author.

On the phone with a probation officer who was preparing a sentencing report for one of her criminal defense clients, Nina raised her eyebrows, but Sandy&#x2019;s expression did not alter.<br> <br>The secretary and lone staffer in the Law Offices of Nina Reilly, Sandy ordinarily stood at Nina&#x2019;s desk, so either she was tired or some cataclysm was afoot. Since at 8:00 a.m. Sandy usually was well into her fourth cup of coffee, she probably wasn&#x2019;t tired. She had been hard at work when Nina arrived, and Nina had meant to ask her what was bringing her into the office so early these days, and why she would close out the file on her computer whenever Nina came near.<br> <br>Outside, the weather had turned cloudy, the thick white clouds that meant they would have snow. This was the tumultuous season, as the mountains left winter and moved into spring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, gotta go. Call you back later,&#x201d; Nina told the officer, and hung up. &#x201c;So?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Scumbags have been sitting in these chairs for four years now,&#x201d; Sandy observed. She wore a belt with small silver conchas and tan leather cowboy boots under a long skirt. A member of the Washoe tribe, Sandy had lately gone country-western in her dress, and the appearance of a snorting stallion in the parking lot one night would not surprise Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;They do the job.&#x201d; Nina got up, spun one, and tried not to notice the ugly brown stain not exactly adorning its back. When had that got there?<br> <br>&#x201c;We need new chairs. Comfortable. Leather so they clean easier.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s low on the list.&#x201d; Nina indicated the stack of files and phone messages stacked neatly on her desk. &#x201c;Today, we work on generating cash, not spending it. As I recall, you told me Friday that we are low on the accounts receivable front, no surprise, considering that nobody in town has a dime to litigate these days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine, if you like cooties.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So hire a steam cleaner. Do we need to have this conversation right now? Is that why you came in? I&#x2019;m working.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw brown leather chairs at Jay&#x2019;s Furniture over in Reno this weekend. Four hundred apiece, but your clients can rest their heads and they won&#x2019;t have to put their arms on this cold chrome.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No money for extras now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about if you could make five thousand bucks in ten minutes?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina waited, but Sandy sat, arms crossed. Unable to stand it any longer, Nina asked, &#x201c;New client?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone we know awaits outside.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Philip Strong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Strong?&#x201d; Nina felt a nasty stirring in her gut. For two years, she had tried to put that name out of her mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jim Strong&#x2019;s father.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did Philip say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll pay a big retainer for a problem he has.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina covered her eyes with her hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look peaked. Maybe you ought to see a healer. I know one up at Woodfords everyone says&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Philip Strong&#x2019;s waiting in our outer office?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Marched right in five minutes ago. I was busy writing something important, but he didn&#x2019;t mind interrupting. Says it&#x2019;s urgent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina heard herself, voice higher-pitched than usual. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You may not want to, but you oughta. Listen. You have an appointment with Burglar Boy in twenty minutes. Just hear Philip out and I&#x2019;ll scoot him away when you&#x2019;re done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Send him upstairs to John Dominguez.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sandy shook her head. &#x201c;Claims he needs to consult with you. Only you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why is he here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No details, but I&#x2019;m thinking it&#x2019;s about his ski resort.&#x201d;<br> <br>Paradise Ski Resort. Nina pictured the lodge up the mountain behind town, the enormous stone fireplace, handsome people pulling off their rigid boots, downing hot toddies, beers, and champagne, singing loudly, throwing arms around each other before eventually venturing out into the night, heading for their rented condos or a long night of gambling. Straddling the border between Nevada and California, a neighbor to Heavenly Ski Resort, Paradise was a hidden gem. The lifts cost less, the lodge had delicious food, and the runs rivaled world-class Heavenly in their variety.<br> <br>Those really in the know, though, remembered that two years earlier the resort had seen a serious family tragedy, one Nina didn&#x2019;t care to remember.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why, but the phrase <i>deep pockets</i> popped up in my mind the minute I saw him,&#x201d; Sandy continued. &#x201c;You should fit him in.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina leaned back in her chair. The sharp sunlight of Lake Tahoe in March lanced through the window. Only a few miles to the east in Nevada, across the Sierra massif, in the high desert, the sun reigned most of the year. Outside in the well-plowed street of the mountain town, old Hummers and other full-size trucks and SUVs tankered by as though the price of gas had never been close to five bucks a gallon, the vehicles spattered brown with slush.<br> <br>Nina made her palm into a stop sign. &#x201c;I never want to hear Jim Strong&#x2019;s name again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sandy nodded. &#x201c;Neither does Philip, I&#x2019;m thinking. Look, he&#x2019;s one of the few people left in this town with money.&#x201d; Sandy scratched at the metal arms of the chair, then leaned forward to see the result of her handiwork. &#x201c;But what strikes me is that you need to know what&#x2019;s going on here even if we don&#x2019;t accept him as a client.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Cuz if it&#x2019;s about his son, it affects you. You&#x2019;ll get lassoed into his stuff sideways if you&#x2019;re not careful. At least find out why he came.&#x201d; Sandy had the strongest fingernails of any human on the planet, it appeared. They continued scratching on the chair arm in one tiny place. The chrome began to disappear as though she were using a tiny Brillo pad.<br> <br>&#x201c;Direct him upstairs.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the door, Sandy turned once more to Nina, her eyebrow cocked into a final question mark.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell him I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Nina said. The door closed, and Nina went to the tiny mirror by the door, examining the blowy hair, the darkness under the eyes, the brown eyes that now appeared almost amber, translucent in the reflection from the light behind her.<br> <br>No one had ever hated her, hurt her, or scared her as Philip Strong&#x2019;s son had. Nina would never recover from the blows, never. Knowing Jim would never come back helped her to sleep at night. She walked a few more steps to the corner of the big window, where she liked to look out over her personal shimmering sliver of Lake Tahoe.<br> <br>In the outer office, voices competed for airspace, Sandy&#x2019;s mostly prevailing. Nina recalled Philip Strong as a quiet man, and Sandy seldom raised her voice, so why all the shouting? A crash made her rush to open her office door and take a look.<br> <br>Sandy, feet stuck to the floor, sturdy as a tripod, gripped the back of Strong&#x2019;s parka like a bouncer. Sure of her hold, she shoved him implacably toward the door. Strong grabbed the jambs, preventing her from propelling him out, yelling, &#x201c;I need to see her!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sandy?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sandy paused and looked back at Nina, eyes her usual cold coal black. &#x201c;Told him you had other plans for him. Upstairs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not leaving!&#x201d; Philip cried. &#x201c;This is important, damn it!&#x201d;<br> <br>Sandy&#x2019;s grip tightened. Nina, recalling some old business between Philip and Sandy&#x2019;s mother, something vague, something that probably made Sandy nuts, said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Sandy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sandy held tight. Was that a hank of hair stretching between the fingers of her left hand? Philip yelped again. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Sandy asked after a few moments of Philip&#x2019;s twisting left and right, bubbling with anger but unable to free himself from her hold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Nina said.<br> <br>Sandy let go.<br> <br>Philip, caught off guard, nearly fell to the floor, tried to regain his balance, and set a hard hand against the wall to steady himself. He pulled a hand through his thinning hair as if to recapture his lost dignity.<br> <br>Sandy adjusted her belt and brushed off her skirt.<br> <br>Then they both looked at Nina. &#x201c;I found a minute,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Strong righted himself and said, &#x201c;Sorry, Sandy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hnf.&#x201d; Sandy went to her desk and plopped down to a ringing phone. While she answered it and Philip Strong tucked his shirt back into his pants, Nina took a good look at him.<br> <br>He had aged. Thick, dark hair that once curled around the bottom half of his skull had diminished to wispy white strands since she last saw him. He had lost weight in two years. He must be in his sixties by now. Even so, he maintained an attitude of physical health, wearing a red parka and jeans that accentuated stringy, once athletic legs. He stared back at her as if he&#x2019;d forgotten what she looked like. He looks haunted, she thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; she said, holding the door.<br> <br>Almost as the door clicked shut, he was saying, &#x201c;I have news, Nina. It&#x2019;s killing my family. It might kill you, too. But you need to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>She tensed. A threat, not even two minutes into the conversation. She had been right to want him upstairs, not here, in her face, frightening her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jim&#x2019;s alive.

In this work Kant seeks to establish the a priori principles underlying the faculty of judgement, just as he did in his previous analyses of pure and practical reason. The first part deals with the subject of our aesthetic sensibility; we respond to certain natural phenomena as beautiful, says Kant, when we recognise in nature a harmonious order that satisfies the mind&#39;s own need for order. The second half of the critique concentrates on the apparent teleology in nature&#39;s design of organisms, i.e., organisms display a complex inter-working of parts, which are subordinated as means to serve the purpose of the whole. All of this suggests, concludes Kant, that our minds are inclined to attribute a final purpose to nature&#39;s design and to life as a whole. This natural tendency to see purpose in nature is the main principle underlying all of our judgements. Although this might imply a super-sensible Designer behind nature and a theistic interpretation of the world, in the final analysis Kant maintains an agnostic stance. Ever the objective philosopher he insists that though we are predisposed to read design and purpose into nature, we cannot therefore prove a supernatural dimension or the existence of God. Such considerations are beyond reason and are solely the province of faith.</p><p><b>IMMANUEL KANT</b>, born in K�nigsberg, East Prussia (in what is now Kaliningrad, Russia), on April 22, 1724, was reared by parents who were members of the Lutheran sect known as Pietists. Though his upbringing was religious, Kant did not find himself subjected to a dogmatic or doctrinaire home environment. After completing his early education at the Collegium Fridericianum, he entered the University of K�nigsberg in 1740 at the age of sixteen. Though it was originally thought that he would make the ministry his life&#x2019;s pursuit, Kant took the minimum number of required courses in theology and then dedicated himself to philosophy, mathematics, and physical science. During the years between 1746 and 1755 he worked as a private tutor in an effort to support himself through graduate work after the death of his parents left him without financial assistance. Receiving his doctorate in 1755, he taught at the University of K�nigsberg for fifteen years until 1770 when he was finally promoted to Professor of Logic and Metaphysics. Kant held this position until his death on February 12, 1804.&nbsp;<br><br>Among Kant&#x2019;s most important philosophical works are:&nbsp;<i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>&nbsp;(1781),&nbsp;<i>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics&nbsp;</i>(1783),<i>&nbsp;Idea for a Universal History</i>&nbsp;(1784),&nbsp;<i>Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals</i>&nbsp;(1785),&nbsp;<i>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science</i>&nbsp;(1786),&nbsp;<i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>&nbsp;(1787),&nbsp;<i>Critique of Judgment&nbsp;</i>(1790),&nbsp;<i>Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone</i>&nbsp;(1793),&nbsp;<i>Perpetual Peace</i>&nbsp;(1795),&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics of Ethics&nbsp;</i>(1797), and&nbsp;<i>Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View&nbsp;</i>(1798).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Heart of the Matter</h2><p>Cover slightly scuffed.

His father, leading the wise and benevolent Council of Mages, protected and guided the citizens of the Golden City of the Bells. Young Mages in training-all men, for women were unfit to practice magic-memorized the intricate details of High Magic and aspired to seats on the council. <br><br>Then he found the forbidden Books of Wild Magic-or did they find him? The three slim volumes woke Kellen to the wide world outside the City's isolating walls. Their Magic was not dead, strangled by rules and regulations. It felt like a living thing, guided by the hearts and minds of those who practiced it and benefited from it. <br><br>Questioning everything he has known, Kellen discovers too many of the City's dark secrets. Banished, with the Outlaw Hunt on his heels, Kellen invokes Wild Magic-and finds himself running for his life with a unicorn at his side. <br><br>Kellen's life changes almost faster than he can understand or accept. Rescued by a unicorn, healed by a female Wild Mage who knows more about Kellen than anyone outside the City should, meeting Elven royalty and Elven warriors, and plunged into a world where the magical beings he has learned about as abstract concepts are flesh and blood creatures-Kellen both revels in and fears his new freedom.<br><br>Especially once he learns about Demons. He'd always thought they were another abstract concept-a stand-in for ultimate evil. But if centaurs and dryads are real, then Demons surely are as well. And the one thing all the Mages of the City agreed on was that practicing Wild Magic corrupted a Mage. Turned him into a Demon. Would that be Kellen's fate? <br><br>Deep in Obsidian Mountain, the Demons are waiting. Since their defeat in the last great War, they've been biding their time, sowing the seeds of distrust and discontent between their human and Elven enemies. Very soon now, when the Demons rise to make war, there will be no alliance between High and Wild Magic to stand against them. And all the world will belong to the Endarkened. <br><br></p><p><b>The Books of Wild Magic</b><br><br>There were three of them, at the bottom of a pile of ledgers, very slender volumes bound in some fine-grained, dark leather, with just a touch of gilt on the spine. Kellen found himself turning them over in his hands with some puzzlement. There was nothing on the spine of each but a single image-a sun, a crescent moon, and a star. Nothing on the cover, not even a bit of tooling, and the covers themselves were in pristine condition.<br><br>Odd. Definitely out of keeping with the rest of the used bookseller's wares.<br><br>He opened the front covers. The title pages were handwritten, not printed. The Book of Sun. The Book of Moon. The Book of Stars. He leafed through the pages, trying to puzzle out the tiny writing. The contents were handwritten as well . . . and seemingly dealt with magic.<br><br>They shouldn't be here at all! Kellen thought with a sudden surge of glee. Books on magic were very closely kept, with Students returning their workbooks to their Tutors as they outgrew them. And these weren't any of the recognized Student books, or anything like them, as far as Kellen could tell. <br><br>Without bothering to look through them further, he put them on the top of his pile and caught the stallholder's eye.<br><br>"Got younger sibs at home, do you?" the man asked as he wrote up a bill of sale with the merest stub of a graphite rod. <br><br>"No," said Kellen, startled. "Why do you ask?"<br><br>"Well, children's stories.... The man gestured at the three books. He handed Kellen his receipt. <br>Kellen studied it in confusion.

On the advice of a renowned expert in gender identity and sexual reassignment at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the boy was surgically altered to live as a girl. This landmark case, initially reported to be a complete success, seemed all the more remarkable since the child had been born an identical twin: his uninjured brother, raised as a boy, provided to the experiment the perfect matched control.</p><p>The so-called twins case would become one of the most famous in modern medicine and the social sciences; cited repeatedly over the past thirty years as living proof that our sense of being male or female is not inborn but primarily the result of how we are raised. A touchstone for the feminist movement, the case also set the precedent for sex reassignment as standard treatment for thousands of newborns with similarly injured, or irregular, genitals.</p><p>But the case was a failure from the outset. From the start the famous twin had, in fact, struggled against his imposed girlhood. Since age fourteen, when finally informed of his medical history, he made the decision to live as a male. John Colapinto tells this extraordinary story for the first time in As Nature Made Him. Writing with uncommon intelligence, insight, and compassion, he also sets the historical and medical context for the case, exposing the thirty-year-long scientific feud between Dr. John Money and his fellow sex researcher, Dr. Milton Diamond--a rivalry over the nature/nurture debate whose very bitterness finally brought the truth to light. A macabre tale of medical arrogance, <em>As Nature Made Him</em> is first and foremost a human drama of one man's-and one family's--amazing survival in the face of terrible odds. The human intimacy of the story is all the greater for the subject's courageous decision to step out from behind the pseudonym that has shrouded his identity for the past thirty years.</p></p><p>Once you begin reading <i>As Nature Made Him</i>, a mesmerizing story of a medical tragedy and its traumatic results, you absolutely won't want to put it down. Following a botched circumcision, a family is convinced to raise their infant son, Bruce, as a girl. They rename the child Brenda and spend the next 14 years trying to transform him into a her. Brenda's childhood reads as one filled with anxiety and loneliness, and her fear and confusion are present on nearly every page concerning her early childhood. Much of her pain is caused by Dr. Money, who is presented as a villainous medical man attempting to coerce an unwilling child to submit to numerous unpleasant treatments.<p> Reading over interviews and reports of decisions made by this doctor, it's difficult to contain anger at the widespread results of his insistence that natural-born gender can be altered with little more than willpower and hormone treatments. The attempts of his parents, twin brother, and extended family to assist Brenda to be happily female are touching--the sense is overwhelmingly of a family wanting to do "right" while being terribly mislead as to what "right" is for her. As Brenda makes the decision to live life as a male (at age 14), she takes the name David and begins the process of reversing the effects of estrogen treatments. David's ultimately successful life--a solid marriage, honest and close family relationships, and his bravery in making his childhood public--bring an uplifting end to his story. Equally fascinating is the latest segment of the longtime nature/nurture controversy, and the interviews of various psychological researchers and practitioners form a larger framework around David's struggle to live as the gender he was meant to be. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>John Colapinto has written for <em>Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Esquire, Mademoiselle, Us Weekly,</em> and <em>Rolling Stone,</em> where the landmark National Magazine Award-winning article that was the basis for <em>As Nature Made Him</em> first appeared. He is also the author of the novel <em>About the Author</em>.

Dolphins flash in the blue waters around it, sea otter play in the vast kep beds, and sea elephants loll on the stony beaches. </p><p>Here, in the early 1800s, according to history, an Indian girl spent eighteen years alone, and this beautifully written novel is her story. It is a romantic adventure filled with drama and heartache, for not only was mere subsistence on so desolate a spot a near miracle, but Karana had to contend with the ferocious pack of wild dogs that had killed her younger brother, constantly guard against the Aleutian sea otter hunters, and maintain a precarious food supply.</p><p>More than this, it is an adventure of the spirit that will haunt the reader long after the book has been put down.

A classic tale of discovery and solitude returns to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for its 50th anniversary, with a new introduction by Lois Lowry.<br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Lois Lowry on Writing the Introduction to <i>Island of the Blue Dolphins, 50th Anniversary Edition</i></b></p><p></p> Dear Amazon readers,<p></p> <p></p> Last summer, when I was asked to write an introduction to a new edition of <i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>, my mind went back in time to the 1960s, when my children were young and it was one of their best-loved books.<p></p> But a later memory surfaced, as well, of a party I was invited to in the summer of 1979. By now the kids were grown. I was in New York to attend a convention of the American Library Association, and Scott O'Dell's publisher, Houghton Mifflin, was honoring him at a reception being held at the St. Regis Hotel. I had never met Mr. O'Dell. But because of my own children I knew his books, and I was pleased to be invited to such an illustrious event.<p></p> I was staying at a nearby hotel and planned to walk over to the party. But when I began to get dressed, I encountered a problem. I was wearing, I remember, a rose-colored cr�pe de Chine dress. It buttoned up the back. I was alone in my hotel room. I buttoned the bottom buttons, and I buttoned the top buttons, but there was one button in the middle of my back that I simply couldn&#x2019;t reach. It makes me laugh today, thinking about it, picturing the contortions I went through in that hotel room: twisting my arms, twisting my back, all to no avail. <p></p> The clock was ticking. The party would start soon. I had no other clothes except the casual things I'd been wearing all day and which were now wrinkled from the summer heat.<p></p> Finally I decided, <i>The heck with it</i>. I left the room with the button unbuttoned and headed off. When I got in my hotel elevator, a benign-looking older couple, probably tourists from the Midwest, were already standing inside, and I explained my predicament politely and asked if they could give me a hand. The gray-haired man kindly buttoned my dress for me.<p></p> We parted company in the lobby of my hotel and off I went to the St. Regis, where I milled around and chatted with countless people, sipped wine, and waited for the guest of honor, Scott O'Dell, to be introduced. When he was, of course he turned out to be the eighty-one-year-old man who had buttoned my dress.<p></p> But wait! There's more. Ten years passed.<p></p> I had never seen Mr. O'Dell during the intervening years, but now, suddenly, we were the two speakers at a luncheon being held on a college campus somewhere. I think it may have been Vassar.<p></p> We sat next to each other at the head table, nibbling our chicken, chatting about the weather. I knew he wouldn't remember me, but I certainly remembered him, and I was secretly thinking that when it was my turn to speak, I might tell the audience the amusing little anecdote about the button on my dress. But he went first. And, eyes twinkling, he started his speech with "The last time I was with Lois Lowry, we were in a New York hotel. I was helping her get dressed." He was ninety-one at the time. All of this floated back into my mind when I found myself rereading, last summer, <i>The Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>. None of it was appropriate to the book's introduction, of course, and I went on to write, instead, about the power of the story and the magnificence of the writing. Not that anyone needed reminding! There has never been a question about Scott O'Dell's brilliance as a writer and storyteller. But it's nice to have a chance, here, to tell an audience that he was also a sweet and funny man.<p></p> <i>Lois Lowry</i><p></p> <p>(Photo � Neil Giordano)</p> <br> <br><i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>978-0-547-32861-4$6.99 PA</p><h2>Animal Giants (Kingfisher Knowledge)</h2><p><p>Marvel at the most magnificent and powerful animals ever to have inhabited the earth, from the fifty-ton supersaurus of the Late Jurassic era to the immense African elephant.

The more often users run through these hooks, the more likely they are to form habits.</p><p></p><p>How I Got Hooked</p><p>In 2008 I was among a team of Stanford MBAs starting a company backed by some of the brightest investors in Silicon Valley. Our mission was to build a platform for placing advertising into the booming world of online social games.</p><p>Notable companies were making hundreds of millions of dollars selling virtual cows on digital farms while advertisers were spending huge sums of money to influence people to buy whatever they were peddling. I admit I didn&#x2019;t get it at first and found myself standing at the water&#x2019;s edge wondering, &#x201c;How do they do it?&#x201d;</p><p>At the intersection of these two industries dependent on mind manipulation, I embarked upon a journey to learn how products change our actions and, at times, create compulsions. How did these companies engineer user behavior? What were the moral implications of building potentially addictive products? Most important, could the same forces that made these experiences so compelling also be used to build products to improve people&#x2019;s lives?</p><p>Where could I find the blueprints for forming habits? To my disappointment, I found no guide. Businesses skilled in behavior design guarded their secrets, and although I uncovered books, white papers, and blog posts tangentially related to the topic, there was no how-to manual for building habit-forming products.</p><p>I began documenting my observations of hundreds of companies to uncover patterns in user-experience designs and functionality. Although every business had its unique flavor, I sought to identify the commonalities behind the winners and understand what was missing among the losers.</p><p>I looked for insights from academia, drawing upon consumer psychology, human-computer interaction, and behavioral economics research. In 2011 I began sharing what I learned and started working as a consultant to a host of Silicon Valley companies, from small start-ups to Fortune 500 enterprises. Each client provided an opportunity to test my theories, draw new insights, and refine my thinking. I began blogging about what I learned at NirAndFar.com, and my essays were syndicated to other sites. Readers soon began writing in with their own observations and examples.</p><p>In the fall of 2012 Dr. Baba Shiv and I designed and taught a class at the Stanford Graduate School of Business on the science of influencing human behavior. The next year, I partnered with Dr. Steph Habif to teach a similar course at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.</p><p>These years of distilled research and real-world experience resulted in the creation of the Hook Model: a four-phase process companies use to forms habits.</p><p>Through consecutive Hook cycles, successful products reach their ultimate goal of unprompted user engagement, bringing users back repeatedly, without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.</p><p>While I draw many examples from technology companies given my industry background, hooks are everywhere&#x2014;in apps, sports, movies, games, and even our jobs. Hooks can be found in virtually any experience that burrows into our minds (and often our wallets). The four steps of the Hook Model provide the framework for the chapters of this book.</p><p>The Hook Model</p><p>1. Trigger</p><p>A <i>trigger</i> is the actuator of behavior&#x2014;the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: external and internal.8 Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an e-mail, a Web site link, or the app icon on a phone.</p><p>For example, suppose Barbra, a young woman in Pennsylvania, happens to see a photo in her Facebook News Feed taken by a family member from a rural part of the state. It&#x2019;s a lovely picture and because she is planning a trip there with her brother Johnny, the external trigger&#x2019;s call to action (in marketing and advertising lingo) intrigues her and she clicks. By cycling through successive hooks, users begin to form associations with internal triggers, which attach to existing behaviors and emotions.</p><p>When users start to automatically cue their next behavior, the new habit becomes part of their everyday routine. Over time, Barbra associates Facebook with her need for social connection. Chapter 2 explores external and internal triggers, answering the question of how product designers determine which triggers are most effective.</p><p>2. Action</p><p>Following the trigger comes the action: the behavior done in anticipation of a reward. The simple action of clicking on the interesting picture in her news feed takes Barbra to a Web site called Pinterest, a &#x201c;social bookmarking site with a virtual pinboard.&#x201d;9</p><p>This phase of the Hook, as described in chapter 3, draws upon the art and science of usability design to reveal how products drive specific user actions. Companies leverage two basic pulleys of human behavior to increase the likelihood of an action occurring: the ease of performing an action and the psychological motivation to do it.10</p><p>Once Barbra completes the simple action of clicking on the photo, she is dazzled by what she sees next.</p><p>3. Variable Reward</p><p>What distinguishes the Hook Model from a plain vanilla feedback loop is the Hook&#x2019;s ability to create a craving. Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don&#x2019;t create desire. The unsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn&#x2019;t drive you to keep opening it again and again. However, add some variability to the mix&#x2014;suppose a different treat magically appears in your fridge every time you open it&#x2014;and voil�, intrigue is created.</p><p>Variable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users; chapter 4 explains them in further detail. Research shows that levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine surge when the brain is expecting a reward.11 Introducing variability multiplies the effect, creating a focused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating the parts associated with wanting and desire.12 Although classic examples include slot machines and lotteries, variable rewards are prevalent in many other habit-forming products.</p><p>When Barbra lands on Pinterest, not only does she see the image she intended to find, but she is also served a multitude of other glittering objects. The images are related to what she is generally interested in&#x2014;namely things to see on her upcoming trip to rural Pennsylvania&#x2014;but there are other things that catch her eye as well. The exciting juxtaposition of relevant and irrelevant, tantalizing and plain, beautiful and common, sets her brain&#x2019;s dopamine system aflutter with the promise of reward. Now she&#x2019;s spending more time on Pinterest, hunting for the next wonderful thing to find. Before she knows it, she&#x2019;s spent forty-five minutes scrolling.</p><p>Chapter 4 also explores why some people eventually lose their taste for certain experiences and how variability impacts their retention.</p><p>4. Investment</p><p>The last phase of the Hook Model is where the user does a bit of work. The investment phase increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the Hook cycle in the future. The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money.</p><p>However, the investment phase isn&#x2019;t about users opening up their wallets and moving on with their day. Rather, the investment implies an action that improves the service for the next go-around. Inviting friends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, and learning to use new features are all investments users make to improve their experience. These commitments can be leveraged to make the trigger more engaging, the action easier, and the reward more exciting with every pass through the Hook cycle. Chapter 5 delves into how investments encourage users to cycle through successive hooks.</p><p>As Barbra enjoys endlessly scrolling through the Pinterest cornucopia, she builds a desire to keep the things that delight her. By collecting items, she gives the site data about her preferences. Soon she will follow, pin, repin, and make other investments, which serve to increase her ties to the site and prime her for future loops through the Hook.</p><p>A New Superpower</p><p>Habit-forming technology is already here, and it is being used to mold our lives. The fact that we have greater access to the web through our various connected devices&#x2014;smartphones and tablets, televisions, game consoles, and wearable technology&#x2014;gives companies far greater ability to affect our behavior.</p><p>As companies combine their increased connectivity to consumers, with the ability to collect, mine, and process customer data at faster speeds, we are faced with a future where everything becomes potentially more habit forming. As famed Silicon Valley investor Paul Graham writes, &#x201c;Unless the forms of technological progress that produced these things are subject to different laws than technological progress in general, the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40.&#x201d;13 Chapter 6 explores this new reality and discusses the morality of manipulation.</p><p>Recently, a blog reader e-mailed me, &#x201c;If it can&#x2019;t be used for evil, it&#x2019;s not a superpower.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s right. And under this definition, building habit-forming products is indeed a superpower. If used irresponsibly, bad habits can quickly degenerate into mindless, zombielike addictions.</p><p>Did you recognize Barbra and her brother Johnny from the previous example? Zombie film buffs likely did. They are characters from the classic horror flick <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, a story about people possessed by a mysterious force, which compels their every action.14</p><p>No doubt you&#x2019;ve noticed the resurgence of the zombie genre over the past several years. Games like <i>Resident Evil</i>, television shows like <i>The Walking Dead</i>, and movies including <i>World War Z</i> are a testament to the creatures&#x2019; growing appeal. But why are zombies suddenly so fascinating? Perhaps technology&#x2019;s unstoppable progress&#x2014;ever more pervasive and persuasive&#x2014;has grabbed us in a fearful malaise at the thought of being involuntarily controlled.</p><p>Although the fear is palpable, we are like the heroes in every zombie film&#x2014;threatened but ultimately more powerful. I have come to learn that habit-forming products can do far more good than harm. Choice architecture, a concept described by famed scholars Thaler, Sunstein, and Balz in their same-titled scholarly paper, offers techniques to influence people&#x2019;s decisions and affect behavioral outcomes. Ultimately, though, the practice should be &#x201c;used to help nudge people to make better choices (as judged by themselves).&#x201d;15 Accordingly, this book teaches innovators how to build products to help people do the things they already want to do but, for lack of a solution, don&#x2019;t do.</p><p><i>Hooked</i> seeks to unleash the tremendous new powers innovators and entrepreneurs have to influence the everyday lives of billions of people. I believe the trinity of access, data, and speed presents unprecedented opportunities to create positive habits.</p><p>When harnessed correctly, technology can enhance lives through healthful behaviors that improve our relationships, make us smarter, and increase productivity.</p><p>The Hook Model explains the rationale behind the design of many successful habit-forming products and services we use daily. Although not exhaustive given the vast amount of academic literature available, the model is intended to be a practical tool (rather than a theoretical one) made for entrepreneurs and innovators who aim to use habits for good. In this book I have compiled the most relevant research, shared actionable insights, and provided a practical framework designed to increase the innovator&#x2019;s odds of success.</p><p>Hooks connect the user&#x2019;s problem with a company&#x2019;s solution frequently enough to form a habit. My goal is to provide you with a deeper understanding of ...</p></p><h2>One Hundred Butterflies</h2><p>In <em>One Hundred Butterflies,</em> photographer Harold Feinstein&nbsp;showcases butterfly varieties from around the world, turning exquisite details into mesmerizing works of art.

The author begins the book by describing the events in September that signal to the peregrine that it is time to migrate. When the bird begins her migration, she tells how she uses instinct and her excellent eyesight to identify mountains and rivers that guide her on her way south. The migration requires a lot of energy and exposes the peregrine to numerous dangers. The author tells how the peregrine eats pigeons, doves and other prey and how she bathes herself after eating a messy meal. Since migration is tiring, the peregirine stops on the Texas coast to rest and to build up a reserve of energy for her long flight over the Gulf of Mexico. During her first night over the water, she perches on a ship's mast to rest. A few days later, she flies over Guatemala and then Panama. Along the way, she joins other peregrines on their way south and a flock of Swainson's and broad-winged hawks flying the same route. From Panama, she flies over the ocean to Colombia and then on to Brazil. As she nears the end of her journey, she begins to fly fewer miles each day. One night in Bolivia, she is lucky and does not wind up being dinner for a great horned owl. Finally, the falcon arrives in Argentina; where she will stay until next March, when she migrates back to Alaska. This well-illustrated, well-written book provides a wealth of information about peregrine falcons, bird migration, and predator-prey relationships. It would be an excellent addition to a school library or to a child's personal library. I recommend THE PEREGRINE'S JOURNEY highly.<br>&#x2014;James W.

He is the assistant book review editor for Friends Journal and director of the Ministry of Writing Annual Colloquium at Earlham School of Religion. He lives in Plainfield, Indiana.It's high time the traditional Publishers of Truth as Quakers originally called themselves published something for today's general readers outside the Quaker fold. Bill's anthology picks up where the Quaker Reader (edited by novelist Jessamyn West) left, focusing on writings from the latter half of the 20th century. The prose mix is lively: nonfiction devotional slices from modern mystic Thomas Kelly are served up along with such fiction as an excerpt from the murder mystery Quaker Testimony by Irene Allen, pen name for geologist Elsa Kirsten Peters. Such dizzying range makes the point that contemporary Quakers liberal, pastoral, evangelical can be mildly or wildly different despite common core beliefs in peace, simplicity, truth telling and ongoing divine revelation. At the same time it offers excerpts from such better known Quaker believers as James Michener and Richard Foster, the anthology introduces such unsung writers as children's book specialist Elfrida Vipont Foulds, one of a notably large cadre of women who have always been empowered in Quaker tradition to speak or write. Anthologies are necessarily arbitrary, acknowledges editor Bill, an Earlham College writing program graduate who provides helpful biographical introductions. Still, the influential writer-educator Parker Palmer should have been included. However, this collection is a welcome reminder that the small Society of Friends, as Quakers are also known, continues to offer creative and relevant witness to the truth as found within and practiced in community. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Watercolor Painting on Location</h2><p>Suggests what equipment and materials to take on painting trips, demonstrates watercolor techniques, and discusses composition, color, washes, and glazes</p><p></p><h2>A Romance on Three Legs: Glenn Gould&#39;s Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Piano</h2><p>A grand tale of obsession about the brilliant Glenn Gould and the unique, temperamental instrument he came to love beyond all others, by a top <i>New York Times</i> writer.<br>Glenn Gould was one of the most complex, brilliant artists of the twentieth century, a musician famous for bizarre habits: he wore a hat and gloves even on the warmest summer day; refused to shake hands for fear of germs or damaged fingers; hummed and conducted himself while he played; and traveled the world with a battered old chair, refusing to perform while sitting on anything else. <br>But perhaps Gould&#x2019;s greatest obsession of all was with a Steinway concert grand known as CD318. To explain that relationship, which Gould himself described as &#x201c;a romance on three legs,&#x201d; Katie Hafner introduces us to the important figures in Gould&#x2019;s life, including Verne Edquist, his longtime, long-suffering, blind tuner. She offers a fascinating history of the art of tuning, and takes us inside Steinway during the war years, when CD318 was built. And she dissects Gould&#x2019;s life with the piano, from his first encounter with it to the endless coddling and tweaking that Edquist performed over the years. Hafner includes Gould&#x2019;s stormy, sometimes outrageous, correspondence with Steinway, and describes his despair when CD318 was fatally dropped from a loading dock.<br>The book will appeal to fans of books like <i>The Piano Shop on the Left Bank</i>, as well as to those looking fora rich story of obsession like <i>The Orchid Thief</i>.</p><p>Katie Hafner is a correspondent for the <i>New York Times</i> and the author or coauthor of four books, including <i>Where Wizards Stay Up Late</i>, <i>Cyberpunk</i>, <i>The Well</i>, and <i>The House at the Bridge</i>. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.And then there was the piano, which the National Library had decided to purchase from Gould&#x2019;s estate. An eight-foot-eleven-and-one-quarter-inch Steinway concert grand, it was known as CD 318 (<i>C </i>to signify its special status as having been put aside for the use of Steinway concert artists, and <i>D </i>denoting it as the largest of Steinway&#x2019;s pianos). Like every Steinway piano, it bore its own serial number: 317194. Helmut Kallmann, the head of the library&#x2019;s music division, oversaw the delivery of CD 318 and later described how all 1,325 pounds of it were unloaded by three expert burly movers and unceremoniously deposited in the ground-floor lobby of the library. They untied the straps, removed the pads, attached the legs, requested a signature, and left.<br><br>A musician himself, Kallmann was a devotee of Gould&#x2019;s work. In the 1960s, he had occasionally crossed paths with Gould at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, where Kallmann supervised the music library. Gould showed up from time to time to pick up musical scores and often stopped to chat. The pianist&#x2019;s eccentricities were always evident, as was his charm. Gould once endeared himself to Kallmann by asking, &#x201c;What key do you think my personality is in?&#x201d; <br><br>Like most Gould fans, Kallmann was familiar with the pianist&#x2019;s legendary Chickering, a one-hundred-year-old small grand that Gould had famously adored. But when it came time to purchase one of Gould&#x2019;s pianos for the National Library&#x2019;s permanent collection, Kallmann and his colleagues in the music division knew it had to be CD 318, the piano that had seen Gould through nearly every recording of his career.<br><br>Steinway had made many beautiful instruments over the years&#x2013;not just the classic ebonized concert grands, but also a number of art-case pianos. Among the best-known are an elaborate white-and-gilt decorative piano made for Cornelius Vanderbilt, with paintings of Apollo surrounded by cherubs, and a piano created for the White House, with legs formed of carved eagles. For the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, Steinway had built a tortoiseshell decoration surmounted by a candelabrum. For the oil magnate E. L. Doheny, the company designed a gilded piano in a Louis XV style with carved legs and elaborate moldings. Even Steinway&#x2019;s standard-issue polished-ebony concert grands were stately and handsome, if also austere.<br><br>Not so this instrument.<br><br>The piano that arrived in the early afternoon at the loading bay behind the library, its black case scratched and dented, the lid slightly out of alignment and disfigured by visible gouges, looked every bit the orphan. The archivists in Ottawa knew that this tired-looking instrument had been Gould&#x2019;s favorite concert grand. And they knew that there had once been an accident that had for a time rendered the piano all but unplayable. But that was all they knew.<br><br>One evening shortly after the piano&#x2019;s arrival, after everyone else had left for the day and he was sure he was alone, Kallmann sat down at CD 318 and played on it a bit. He was first taken aback, and then impressed, by the instrument&#x2019;s extreme responsiveness, its improbably light touch. No wonder Gould, whose musicianship was so closely tied to his dexterity, had been so attached to it. Kallmann suddenly felt as if he understood something crucial about the great pianist and the piano he had loved. During Gould&#x2019;s lifetime, fans had speculated that the piano he used must have been altered in some extraordinary way, perhaps rigged with special equipment that would make it possible for Gould&#x2019;s fingers to fly as fast as they did. But Kallmann closely examined the instrument and found nothing out of the ordinary, no piano equivalent of a warp drive. Using ordinary tuning and regulating tools, a piano technician had managed to give the piano its hair-trigger action. Kallmann marveled: That must have been some technician.<br><br>Kallmann took it upon himself to investigate CD 318&#x2019;s provenance. One of the first telephone calls he placed was to the T. Eaton Company, the large Toronto department store whose piano department had been responsible for the instrument for nearly three decades before Gould had purchased it in 1973. Kallmann was directed to Muriel Mussen, who had recently retired from Eaton&#x2019;s after more than thirty years working in the piano department, where she was in charge of choosing from among a stable of large grands for visiting concert artists.<br><br>Oh, yes, said Mussen when Kallmann explained why he was calling. CD 318. And Glenn Gould. Of course. The piano, she said, had come to Eaton&#x2019;s around 1946, and for years famous pianists who came through Toronto in the course of a concert tour had played on it. But as the piano had aged, it had lost its appeal. In fact, in the 1950s, concert pianists began to complain about it. And in 1960, just as Eaton&#x2019;s was preparing to dispose of it&#x2013;by which she meant that the company planned to ship it back to Steinway in exchange for a newer instrument&#x2013;Glenn Gould chanced upon it.<br><br>From the moment he lifted the fallboard, Gould was smitten. He had been famously fussy about his pianos and spent years rejecting most factory-issue Steinways. But here was a piano whose qualities just happened to be ideally aligned to his particular style of playing. Before long, he was playing on CD 318 exclusively. That piano, Mussen observed, came to be as eccentric as Glenn Gould himself, coddled and tweaked and regulated by Mr. Gould&#x2019;s principal technician&#x2013;a man Muriel Mussen referred to simply as Verne&#x2013;to achieve the supremely responsive keyboard action that Gould required. She explained that Gould grew so attached to CD 318, and became so fearful of unfamiliar pianos, that he insisted on taking it with him for important concerts. Later, after he stopped performing in public, he made nearly all his recordings on CD 318.<br><br>Once, Mussen recalled, in the course of extolling the virtues of this piano, Gould told her something about his relationship to CD 318 that she would never forget: &#x201c;This is the first time in history,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that there has ever been a romance on three legs.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The nature of Christ: Help for a church divided over perfection</h2><p>The nature of Christ: Help for a church divided over perfection</p><p></p><h2>The American Century: Art and Culture 1900-1950</h2><p><p><strong>As the century draws to a close, America has become recognized as one of the most, if not the most, powerful artistic and cultural forces in the world.

Included are images from painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, and design, providing a comprehensive overview of artistic and cultural ideas in the first half of this century. The book is broken into four chapters, beginning with "America in the Age of Confidence: 1900-1919," which includes beautiful John Singer Sargent paintings depicting American aristocratic life and silver objects from Tiffany and Company. Next comes the "Jazz Age in America: 1920-1929," with images documenting the importance of cinema: movie stills and an exquisite portrait of Gloria Swanson in lace. Also included in this period is a focus on industrial architecture as seen through the paintings of Charles Sheeler, Charles Demuth, and Joseph Stella, with their precise but almost abstract renderings of the changing American landscape. Chapter 3, "America in Crisis: 1930-1939," and chapter 4, "War and Its Aftermath: 1940-1949," include many photographs that map the changes in American life during this tumultuous period, from the dustbowl photos of Dorothea Lange to Weegee's pictures of the seamier side of New York City. Within the immensity of this catalog are discussions that relate the works of art to specific cultural phenomena and map the changing trends in the creation of American art. <i>--Jennifer Cohen</i>Barbara Haskell is curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

True, indeed, it was, that it might be better done by others. But this could hardly be admitted as a valid excuse, because it would Ope rate equally against every human undertaking. All that I had a right to assume was the necessity of possessing a competent share of the knowledge, reflection, and experience which the work required. The first thirty years of life passed in the stud ies, business, and intercourse of the world - seven of those years given to the profession of the law - sixteen years devoted to the task of education - the training of a numerous family - abun dant opportunities of intimacy, abroad and at home, with all the classes of society, and the whole united, from my youth up, with the constant love of books, and the peculiar tastes and habits of an author - all this seemed to warrant the hope that I might produce a work of some utility on the rights and duties of the American citizen, without any serious diminution of the labors due to the paramount service of the Gospel. At all events, I could not honestly deny that I ought to be tolerably qualified to make the effort, with a fair promise of success; and therefore I concluded that the attempt would not be justly liable to the charge of inconsistency or presumption.<br><br>About the Publisher<br><br>Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Others don&#x2019;t see it, but I do." </em>The enchanted place is an ancient stone prison, viewed through the eyes of a death row inmate who finds escape in his books and in re-imagining life around him, weaving a fantastical story of the people he observes and the world he inhabits. Fearful and reclusive, he senses what others cannot. Though bars confine him every minute of every day, he marries visions of golden horses running beneath the prison, heat flowing like molten metal from their backs with the devastating violence of prison life.</p><p>Two outsiders venture here: a fallen priest and the Lady, an investigator who searches for buried information from prisoners&#x2019; pasts that can save those soon-to-be-executed. Digging into the background of a killer named York, she uncovers wrenching truths that challenge familiar notions of victim and criminal, innocence and guilt, honesty and corruption&#x2014;ultimately revealing shocking secrets of her own.</p><p>Beautiful and transcendent, <em>The Enchanted</em> reminds us of how our humanity connects us all, and how beauty and love exist even amidst the most nightmarish reality.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, March 2014:</strong> Journalist Rene Denfeld channels her experience as a death penalty case investigator into a gut-wrenching, spellbinding debut novel. <em>The Enchanted</em> goes deep inside a decaying prison where we meet York, a death row inmate who is on the verge of execution, and "The Lady," an investigator who (against York's wishes) delves into his history in an attempt to have his sentence reduced. What she finds is far from pretty, revealing parallels to her own awful past. There are others, none without tragedy. But their morbid, often unrepentantly violent stories are balanced with moments of emotional escape--poetic beauty from outside the prison and strange explanations from within. These magical aspects, or "enchanted things," are the sensational imaginings of an unhinged, unnamed inmate--York's prison neighbor and our narrator. His is a unique perspective--one that is at once irrational and insightful, driving the plot and providing context and description beyond the walls of the prison and beyond the realms of reality. The result is captivating and perplexing. Given such dark subjects, "enjoying" <em>The Enchanted</em> may feel uncomfortable, but there&#x2019;s no crime in embracing Denfeld's ability to evoke empathy for seemingly undeserving characters and inspire wonder within an unlikely place. --<em>Robin A. Rothman</em><br></p><p><em>The lady, an investigator who excels at uncovering information to save her clients from execution . . . </em></p><p><em>The fallen priest, beaten down by his guilt over a terrible sin and its tragic consequences . . . </em></p><p><em>The warden, a kind man within a cruel system . . . </em></p><p><em>The mute prisoner, sensing what others cannot in what he calls "this enchanted place" . . .</em></p><p>The enchanted place is an ancient stone prison. Two outsiders walk here: a woman known only as the lady, and a fallen priest. The lady comes to the prison when she has a job to do. She's skilled at finding the secrets that get men off death row. This gift threatens her career&#x2014;and complicates her life&#x2014;when she takes on the case of York, a killer whose date of execution looms. York is different from the lady's former clients: he wants to die. Going against the condemned man's wishes, the lady begins her work. What she uncovers about York's birth and upbringing rings chillingly familiar. In York's shocking and shameful childhood, the lady sees the shadows of her own.</p><p>The lady is watched by a death row inmate who finds escape in the books he reads from the prison library and by reimagining the world he inhabits&#x2014;a world of majestic golden horses that stampede underground and of tiny men who hammer away inside stone walls. He is not named, nor do we know his crime. But he listens. He listens to York's story. He sees the lady fall in love with the priest and wonders how such warmth is possible in these crumbling corridors. As tensions in "this enchanted place" build, he sees the corruption and the danger. And he waits as the hour of his own destiny approaches.</p><p><em>The Enchanted</em> is a magical novel about redemption, the poetry that can exist within the unfathomable, and the human capacity to transcend and survive even the most nightmarish reality. Beautiful and unexpected, this is a memorable story.</p></p><h2>Blue Bay Mystery (The Boxcar Children #6)</h2><p>The Aldens find a castaway on a South Sea island. How did he get there and who is he?</p><p>The Boxcar Children Series was created by Gertrude Chandler Warner, a teacher, when she realized that there were few, if any, books for children that were both easy and fun to read. She drew on her own experiences in writing the mysteries. As a child, she had spent hours watching trains near her home, and often dreamed about what it would be like to live in a caboose or freight car. In each story, she chose a special setting and introduced unpredictable, unusual or eccentric characters, to help highlight the Aldens&#x2019; independence and resourcefulness. Miss Warner lived in Putnam, Massachusetts until her death in 1979.</p><h2>The Fragile Species</h2><p>A distinguished physician sums up his love for his profession and addresses the major issues of our time--AIDS, drug abuse, aging, and especially his vital concern for the environment.</p><p>Further essays by the prolific physician-writer (Et Cetera, Et Cetera, 1990, etc.). Most of these 14 essays (some based on lectures, others revised from Foreign Affairs, Missouri Review, etc.) bear the Thomas watermarks of elegant prose and humanistic values--although sometimes (as in ``Fifty Years Out,'' about all the subjects Thomas still wishes to explore), the impression is water-thin. More substantial are the pieces on AIDS, in which Thomas happily reports that ``the work, in short, is going beautifully'' but adds that ``it is still in its early stages.'' A few ideas keep cropping up (repetitiveness is a problem here)--for instance, that we all share an ``ur-ancestor,'' a bacteria that lived three or four billion years ago; and that two key discoveries formed modern medicine, one being that traditional methods such as bleeding don't work, the other that antibiotics can kill the disease without killing the patient. Like an oyster working a grain of sand, Thomas accretes around these few facts some glistening pearls of prose--among them, a call for massive public-health programs in the Third World; a look at the Gaia hypothesis; a sermon against war; and a worried appraisal of our failure to provide good preschool education. Invariably, he wants to see crises resolved through scientific research, often high-tech; holistic and alternative medicines take several knocks, which won't endear him to younger readers. A literary stethoscope: polished, professional, predictable. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>From the author of The Medusa and the Snail ( LJ 4/15/79) and The Lives of a Cell (Bantam, 1974) comes another collection of essays, ruminations, and observations on topics ranging from becoming a doctor to the process of aging to the threat of nuclear annihilation. Although some of the pieces seem dated at first glance (those on nuclear war in particular), they are not really; they are timeless and graceful in a way that transcends the day-to-day headline changes that so many contemporary essayists chase. The two essays on AIDS in particular are blueprints of reasoned thought and fine examples of an eloquent writer and sensitive observer at work. Thomas continues to expand, inform, educate, and amaze. Once again, he demonstrates that he is one of America's best writers of prose. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 12/91.<br><i>- Mark L.

The photographs in this book, the deeply informed narrative that accompanies them, and the eyewitness accounts of daily life that the author weaves throughout, provide a fresh perspective on our early American ancestors and the places they called home. This book is about how their houses and their life in them, from the wealthy to the impoverished, from New York City to the small farms and plantations of the South, from coastal fishing towns to the Western frontier of Indiana and Kentucky. The stories focus on the remarkably vivid differences from one part of the country to the next, class and culture, and the realities of everyday life for American families. These stories twine around a wide selection of HABS photographs of early houses, covering the variety and evolutions of house styles -- not by labeling the style but by explaining the style in the context of everyday life.<br>Richly illustrated with handsome black-and-white photography of old houses from the Library of Congress Historic American Building Survey (HABS) collection and supplemented with period woodcuts, engravings, drawings, paintings, artifacts, and maps, the book is printed on a 4-color press for a depth of tone. Sidebar excerpts from diaries, journals, and letters inject graphic eyewitness descriptions, adding an additional layer of insight. The book also includes sidebars called Still Standing that traces the history of specific houses, from their origins to the present and includes information on the original family, how the house has evolvedover the centuries, and how it's used today.</p></p><p>Jack Larkin is Chief Historian and Museum Scholar at Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, as well as Affiliate Professor of History at Clark University. <br>Debra Friedman is Head of Interpretation at Old Sturbridge Village.<br>"In his new book, Larkin revisits the architecture of America from 1775 to 1840 and finds the values and dreams of the young republic recorded in wood and stone.

Now available in paperback, <i>Geography of Home</i> reminds us that the house is home to many things. Far more than four walls and a roof, it contains our private and public lives, our families, our memories and aspirations, and reflects our attitudes toward society, culture, the environment, and our neighbors. <br>In a literary tour of the spaces of our homes, noted design essayist Akiko Busch reflects on how we define such elusive qualities as privacy, security, and comfort. Part social history, part architectural history, part personal anecdote, this rich and delightful book uncovers the hidden meanings of the place we call home.</p><p>Akiko Busch is a contributing editor at Metropolis.On the hardcover edition: &#34;Elegant and funny, philosophical and thoroughly absorbing. Busch coaxes meaning and intrigue out of the front door; laundry room, and other humble elements of a house. She makes us realize afresh the fascinating and complex lessons contained in a home.&#34;</p><h2>Multiculturalism &amp; "the Politics of Recognition": An Essay by Charles Taylor</h2><p><br> <p>Can a democratic society treat all its members as equals and also recognize their specific cultural identities? Should it try to ensure the survival of specific cultural groups? Is political recognition of ethnicity or gender essential to a person's dignity? These are some of the questions at the heart of the political controversy over multiculturalism and recognition--a debate that has raged across academic departments, university campuses, ethnic and feminist associations, and governments throughout the world. In this book Charles Taylor offers a historically informed, philosophical perspective on what is at stake in the demand made by many people for recognition of their particular group identities by public institutions. His thoughts serve as a point of departure for commentaries by other leading thinkers, who further relate the demand for recognition to issues of multicultural education, feminism, and cultural separatism. In his essay Taylor compares two competing forms of liberal government: one that protects no particular culture but ensures the rights and welfare of all its citizens, and one that nurtures a particular culture yet also protects the basic rights and welfare of nonconforming citizens. Questioning the desirability and possibility of the first conception, Taylor defends a version of the second. In response Steven Rockefeller warns against the ascendancy of particularist cultural identities over the universal identity of democratic citizens. Michael Walzer defends a liberalism that authorizes democratic citizens to adapt their politics to varying situations, and suggests that a culturally neutral politics best suits the United States. Proposing an alternative perspective to Taylor's presumption of value in foreign cultures, Susan Wolf identifies the demand for multicultural education with an accurate understanding of who "we" Americans are. Amy Gutmann focuses on the debate over multiculturalism and free speech on university campuses, arguing that the demands of liberal democratic education are far greater than either essentialists or deconstructionists commonly recognize. Multiculturalism and "The Politics of Recognition" will stimulate constructive discussion and enlighten public discourse on the difficult issues surrounding multiculturalism. The volume is based on the Inaugural Lecture for the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University, founded in 1990 through an endowment by Laurance S. Rockefeller.</p><br></p><p></p><h2>Food to Live By: The Earthbound Farm Organic Cookbook</h2><p>Organic food is the best food possible.

He lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and two sons. Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Rick&#39;s first novel featuring the heroic young demigod, was the overall winner of the Red House Children&#39;s Book Award in 2006.The fifth volume of the Percy Jackson adventure series follows the travails of the 15-year-old half-human son of the Greek god Poseidon. The dyslexic, hyperactive teen takes on the curse of Achilles&#39;s heel, discovers newfound powers, visits the kingdom of Poseidon, and finds romance as a battle mounts against Kronos. With a touch of teenage geekiness to his voice, Jesse Bernstein is able to master Percy&#39;s sense of angst. While his voice is youthful, however, Bernstein lacks the speed and energy to allow listeners to completely suspend disbelief, and his tone lapses into a whining quality that some may find off-putting.

Refuting those who claim that Bruno Richard Hauptmann was framed, the author presents a convincing case that he was guilty of the kidnap-murder of 20-month-old Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. In this well-documented study Fisher thoroughly covers the case, from the night the baby was taken from his home in Hopewell, N.J., on March 1, 1932, to Hauptmann's execution on April 3, 1936. The author vivifies the people involved: the child's parents; eccentric Dr. Condon who paid the ransom to "Cemetery John"; the competing investigators; the charlatans who offered to ransom the baby for huge sums; etc. Although Fisher notes that the police made mistakes and that Hauptmann's defense was incompetent, he argues that evidence of the accused's guilt is overwhelming.

He lives in Fairfax, VA.</p>Chapter One&nbsp;MINDANAO, PHILIPPINES&nbsp;A Hollywood producer could not have staged a more striking scene than the one Company A, 3rd Battalion of the 75th Rangers, presented as they sallied forth from the shade provided by the hangars they had been waiting in. In single file, the Rangers trotted out into the bright sunlight that beat down upon the tarmac. Doubled over by the weight of their gear, they made for a row of waiting UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, straining to be unleashed like a herd of Thoroughbred racehorses being held in check at the starting gate by their attentive jockeys. Not a hint of cloud corrupted the stunning azure sky above them. Only in the distance, just visible above the vibrant green jungle that surrounded the airfield did a darkening sky on the horizon serve notice to all that a line of violent storms was coming on fast.&nbsp;The stage manager of this little drama was Captain Nathan Dixon, a twenty-eight-year-old graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, who looked more like someone you&#x2019;d bump into on the corner of Broadway and Wall Street than the stylized image that comes to mind when one thought of the commanding officer of a Ranger company. Nicknamed Nate by his friends and referred to as &#x201c;CD&#x201d; by the enlisted personnel in his company, Dixon relied upon his easygoing, confident manner to motivate his subordinates. That did not mean that he was a weak leader. When the situation required it he could conduct himself in a manner that would intimidate a great white. It was a skill he had learned from his father, a man who could bring an errant son to bay with a single, scathing glance. Fortunately, for all parties concerned, Nathan&#x2019;s adroitness as a leader, coupled with an innate knack for small unit tactics, tended to make the occasions when he needed to rely upon such techniques to motivate those entrusted to his command quite rare. Without exception everyone in his company was more than willing to follow him wherever he led.&nbsp;Despite being of average height Nathan Dixon stood out even in the middle of soldiers similarly decked out in their full panoply of equipment and weaponry. This was an attribute that subordinates like his first sergeant found very useful at times like this. Having finished issuing instructions to the company clerk, First Sergeant William Carney headed out onto the airfield behind the last stick of Rangers who had been awaiting the word to board their assigned helicopters. When he reached the spot where Dixon was observing the embarkation of his First Platoon, Carney sidled up on his commanding officer&#x2019;s left. Yelling in order to be heard over the whine of the Blackhawks&#x2019; turbine engines, he made his presence known. &#x201c;Captain, what makes you think the Sulu Sea is going to keep our new battalion commander from finding you?&#x201d;&nbsp;A playful grin lit Dixon&#x2019;s face as he turned toward his first sergeant. &#x201c;I know not what you speak of, First Sergeant. I&#x2019;m just going with the boys out into the jungle for some unscheduled play time.&#x201d;&nbsp;Word that the lieutenant colonel who had just assumed command of the 3rd of the 75th was scheduled to arrive that afternoon to conduct an unannounced inspection of Dixon&#x2019;s forward deployed company had been leaked to Carney by the battalion&#x2019;s operations sergeant back at Fort Lewis, Washington. When Carney informed Dixon of this he changed his mind about accompanying his First Platoon on a five-day operation on the island of Jolo. It was a routine mission, one that was undertaken by one of Dixon&#x2019;s platoons every week or so. These forays had the dual purpose of patrolling areas where terrorists were known to be operating as well as providing the Rangers who belonged to the forward deployed company valuable training. Every now and then Dixon went along more to break the monotony, hone his own skills, and become more familiar with the areas where his company was operating than out of a need to supervise the platoon leader to whom the mission had been assigned. Up until that morning Dixon had been satisfied to sit out this particular patrol back at the company&#x2019;s base camp located north of Zamboanga on the island of Mindanao. Word of the surprise visit quickly convinced him to change his plans.&nbsp;&#x201c;You can run but you can&#x2019;t hide, Captain,&#x201d; Carney chuckled. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t take the colonel long to track you down and catch the next resupply hop to Jolo.&#x201d;&nbsp;Dixon winked. &#x201c;By then we&#x2019;ll be in the midst of the operation, circumstances that will limit the amount of time I&#x2019;ll have to spend with El Jefe.&#x201d; Pronounced hef-a, which was Spanish for &#x201c;chief,&#x201d; the reason why the officers in the battalion had taken up calling their new battalion commander &#x201c;El Jefe&#x201d; even before he had arrived was a mystery. It was just one of those things that someone started and stuck. After taking a moment to inspect Carney from head to toe, noting that he was also arrayed in full battle kit and was toting his M-4 rifle as well, the smirk on Dixon&#x2019;s face grew. &#x201c;I see you have no intention of staying behind to cover my rear.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;As they say back home,&#x201d; Carney quibbled, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s not my job.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re leaving the XO here to take the fire.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be good for Lieutenant Quinn, especially since he&#x2019;s always moaning about how company executive officers never get the face time they deserve. The way I see it, by the time he&#x2019;s able to arrange transportation for the colonel he&#x2019;ll have had his fill of one-on-one time with El Jefe.&#x201d;&nbsp;Peter Quinn, Nathan&#x2019;s executive officer or XO, was a meticulous, hard charging professional, one who tended to become flustered when forced to deal with matters he considered to be trivial and nonmission essential. The image of his XO playing host to their new battalion commander caused Dixon to roar. As he did so he took note that the last man belonging to first platoon was climbing into his assigned helicopter. After composing himself, Dixon scanned the dark, ominous sky to the north. Tugging on Carney&#x2019;s sleeve, he pointed to the coming storm. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;re going to make good our escape we&#x2019;d best be going before that line of squalls hits the airfield.&#x201d; Then, he pointed to a Blackhawk farther down the line. &#x201c;I think it would be a good idea if we spread the wealth. Lieutenant Grimes is on the first chopper. I&#x2019;m manifested on the second. You go with Jones&#x2019;s squad on the number-three slick.&#x201d;&nbsp;Carney nodded as he gave his commanding officer a quick salute and the customary &#x201c;Hooah,&#x201d; a term that served the Rangers as a greeting, a verbal salute, an exclamation of joy, an acknowledgment at the end of a conversation, and a number of other ill-defined purposes that nevertheless always seemed to be understood and appropriate.&nbsp;Satisfied that all was in order Dixon gave the line of Blackhawks straining to be cut loose one last look before tucking his head down low and making for the one he would use to whisk him away from the clutches of an ambitious new battalion commander who was headed his way like the late afternoon storm.&nbsp;JOLO ISLAND, PHILIPPINES&nbsp;When viewed from the helicopter&#x2019;s open door the jungle didn&#x2019;t look very threatening or dangerous. Like all of nature&#x2019;s wonders it had a unique beauty all its own, one that was best enjoyed from a safe distance. But Lieutenant Colonel Robert Delmont knew that appearances were deceiving, especially when Mother Nature was involved. To him the jungle was like a cat, a very large and ill-tempered one who kept her deadly claws concealed until it was too late. This analogy was all the more appropriate since his dislike for the jungle was only slightly more pronounced than his disdain for cats, creatures that possessed a streak of independence that tended to annoy the career officer.&nbsp;By nature Delmont was a dog person, the sort of man who expected prompt and complete obedience. His own collection of canines included three purebred beasts. Two were Labs, a chocolate and a gold. The third was a German Shepherd, his personal darling and the offspring of champions. When not busy making the world safe for Democrats Delmont spent as much time as he could training and caring for those animals, a fact that did little to endear him or his pack to the human members of his family but won him the unflinching devotion of his four-legged charges.&nbsp;Neither his wife nor his children were ever able to come to terms with the idea that the dogs they shared a house with provided the reputed head of their family with an escape from the demands that his professional and personal life placed upon him. They failed to understand that when alone with his Labs and Shepherd Delmont found himself in a perfect world, one in which he was the unquestioned master. It was a place where any and all infractions of his rules, regardless of how slight or unintentional, could be handled with little more than a stern reprimand or, if serious enough, the application of a suitable punishment. Yet no matter how severely he castigated or admonished his animals, they never showed a hint of resentment or lingering anger. Instead, even in the wake of a harsh thrashing his trio of dogs were always quick to beg his forgiveness by demonstrating an appropriate degree of contrite submission. This is not to say that Robert Delmont was a cruel or uncaring man. On the contrary. When the situation called for it he could be quite compassionate, a loving husband, and a doting father. If he had any faults it was his inability to understand that the country he was sworn to defend and the Army to which he belonged was populated with far more cats than dogs.Without really giving it much thought Robert Delmont modeled his career after the behavior of his beloved dogs, a proclivity that endeared him to all the right people. At times his steadfast loyalty to superiors that didn&#x2019;t deserve it was difficult, even painful. Like all career officers he occasionally found himself the subject of undeserved verbal abuse and tirades. Yet his willingness to swallow his pride and endure this sort of treatment without a whine or whimper was not without its rewards. Rung by rung Delmont ascended the prescribed career ladder by doing exactly what he was expected to do and angling for those assignments that conventional wisdom dictated. In this he was greatly aided by a knack for aligning himself with superiors who had been pegged as rising stars by those in the Army who mattered. Eventually he became viewed as one himself, an officer worthy of being groomed for bigger and better things. Though no one told him as much, by the time the results of this year&#x2019;s group battalion command selection board were published, it was clear to all who understood the system that there were stars in his future, provided he continued to perform.&nbsp;That is how a Special Forces officer, fresh out of an assignment in the Pentagon, managed to secure the command of a Ranger battalion. Originally Delmont had been slated to take over a 380-man-plus Special Forces battalion. From a career standpoint it was both a logical and natural progression for him, not to mention a choice assignment that many a career officer would die for. Still, it was one that would have made him little more than a manager, charged with overseeing the support and administration of his battalion&#x2019;s far-flung &#x201c;A&#x201d; teams, the twelve-man units that did all the muddy boots stuff, and the three eleven-man &#x201c;Bravo&#x201d; teams, each capable of supporting six &#x201c;A&#x201d; teams in the field. Even during a major regional contingency, more popularly known as a war Delmont would have little to do with the actual conduct of operations and no opportunity to personally participate in combat operations. Due to the nature of their work there would be times when even he would not know where many of his own troops were or what they were doing.&nbsp;A Ranger battalion on the other hand provided an officer of his grade the opportunity to actually command in the field. While still part of the Army&#x2019;s Special Operations Command Ranger battalions were organized along conventional lines. Squads formed platoons, which belonged to companies that in turn were integral parts of a battalion headed by a lieutenant colonel selected by a Department of the Army board comprised of full colonels who had completed successful battalion commands themselves. Successful command of a battalion would boost Delmont up the next rung in the career ladder when he moved into the zone of consideration for the next higher rank.&nbsp;The officers selected to sit on that board would be required to review the promotion package of every officer eligible to be considered for the grade of O-6, or full colonel. It is a simple process but a long and tedious one, one that allowed the board members something like two minutes per promotion package. Two minutes. In those two minutes each board member had to determine if the officer under consideration was worthy of promotion, if his performance in past assignments indicated that he was capable of handling greater responsibilities. Unable to read every word on every officer evaluation report, board members tended to look for indicators, little cues that stood out and marked this man as being indispensable to the future of the Army. This meant that the sort of battalion a lieutenant colonel had commanded was critical since not all battalions were viewed as being equal. While important in the overall scheme of the Army as a whole a basic training battalion did not require the same sort of leadership skills or place the same demands on its commander that an airborne infantry battalion assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division did. It goes without saying that the officer who had completed a successful command of the airborne battalion was more likely to be viewed by the colonels on the board as more deserving of promotion than the one who had been more or less a chief administrator responsible for tending to the needs of basic trainees. Even more impressive is a former commander who had led his battalion into battle, something that a basic training battalion never did.&nbsp;It also didn&#x2019;t hurt if the officers on the promotion board understood without having to be told what the battalion did. Everyone knew what a Ranger battalion was, a fighting unit whose organization wasn&#x2019;t much different from an airborne or light infantry battalion. The same could not be said of a Special Forces battalion. Unless the members of the board had themselves been in the Special Forces, few fully appreciated the duties and responsibilities that commanding it carried. Hence, given the choice between selecting an officer who was fully qualified and had commanded a Ranger battalion versus one who was equally qualified and had commanded a Special Forces battalion, odds favored the former.&nbsp;Robert Delmont understood the career game very well. He followed the trends, listened to the stories that made their way through the rumor mill, and analyzed the statistics that accompanied the publication of each board&#x2019;s results. He knew who was being promoted, who wasn&#x2019;t and why. For this reason he was determined to secure the command of a battalion that was not only actively engaged in counterterrorism operations but one that would afford its commanding officer numerous opportunities to play a central and aggressive role in the execution of its assigned missions. For his purposes only a Ranger battalion would do. In achieving this goal he needed a little help.&nbsp;In the old Army they were known as rabbis, senior officers who ...</p><h2>Kill It &amp; Grill It: A Guide To Preparing And Cooking Wild Game And Fish</h2><p><br>Ted and Shemane Nugent share their favorite recipes for such exotic fare as wild boar, pheasant, buffalo, and venison.

His story, told here in full for the first time, is a remarkable and illuminating tale of diplomacy and adventure. Abigail Green's sweeping biography follows Montefiore through the realms of court and ghetto, tsar and sultan, synagogue and stock exchange. </p><p> </p><p> Interweaving the public triumph of Montefiore's foreign missions with the private tragedy of his childless marriage, this book brings the diversity of nineteenth-century Jewry brilliantly to life&#x2014;from London to Jerusalem, Rome to St. Petersburg, Morocco to Istanbul. Here we see the origins of Zionism and the rise of international Jewish consciousness, the faltering birth of international human rights, and the making of the modern Middle East. With the globalization and mobilization of religious identities now at the top of the political agenda, Montefiore's life story is relevant as never before. </p><p> </p><p> Mining materials from eleven countries in nine languages, Green's masterly biography bridges the East-West divide in modern Jewish history, presenting the transformation of Jewish life in Europe, the Middle East, and the New World as part of a single global phenomenon. As it reestablishes Montefiore's status as a major historical player, it also restores a significant chapter to the history of our modern world. </p></p><p>Abigail Green is Tutor and Fellow in History, Brasenose College, University of Oxford.Abigail Green is without doubt the most brilliant rising star in modern European Jewish history. Her biography of Moses Montefiore, one of the great torch-bearers of Jewish emancipation, redefines the role played by Jews in the prehistory of globalization, as well as the history of philanthropy. She is a profound historical thinker and a marvelous writer into the bargain. This is a masterpiece of scholarship and historical imagination. (Niall Ferguson)<br><br>An absolutely first-rate biography of the nineteenth-century champion of imperiled Jews. Green's account of Montefiore's faith and his attachment to the land of Israel is especially compelling. Written in a lively manner, this book will have broad appeal. (Todd Endelman, author of <i>The Jews of Britain, 1656-2000</i>)<br><br>This magisterial biography illuminates the life of one of the most important, yet least understood, figures in modern Jewish history. Green shows that European religious sensibility, liberal humanitarianism, and Great Power politics were indispensable preconditions for Jewish emancipation and twentieth-century Jewish politics. Gracefully written, yet supported by massive erudition, Green's book deserves a wide readership. (Derek Penslar, author of <i>Shylock's Children</i>)<br><br>An elegant, accessible, and intellectually impressive book. Sir Moses Montefiore was a dominant presence in Anglo-Jewish society, a towering figure pressing Jewish interests on the international stage.

The picture that emerges is sombre and in some respects shocking. (Geoffrey Alderman <i>Jewish Chronicle</i> 2010-03-04)<br><br>Deeply impressive...Green never allows the reader to lose sight of Montefiore's truly pioneering achievements, or of his courage, generosity, and farsightedness. In writing about this incomparable life, Green has produced an incomparable book. More than a biography, <i>Moses Montefiore</i> takes its place as one of the essential works on modern Jewish history. (Adam Kirsch <i>Tablet Magazine</i> 2010-03-09)<br><br>Green's account is often entertaining...Green, herself a twig on the Sebag Montefiore family tree, is more interested in historical themes she thinks have been neglected: how Montefiore used piety, philanthropy and publicity to rally sympathy on a global scale, paving the way for today's campaigns and interventions on behalf of humanitarian causes.

Although Moon has been a major participant in the world of fashion for more than three decades, she has carefully carved out her own niche - a signature style that dispenses with the erotically suggestive poses favored by many of her male counterparts in favor of the emblems of luxury and nostalgia. Mystery and sensuality are at the core of Moon&#39;s work, whether she&#39;s photographing haute couture, still life, or portraiture. In this book, Moon&#39;s first major retrospective, viewers will be treated to a visual tour-de-force, showing all the genres she has explored in her rich and diverse career.</p><p>Sarah Moon lives in Paris.Born in England in 1940 (as Marielle Hadengue), Moon made her name in haute couture fashion photography with luxurious and mysterious compositions. This gorgeous volume brings together that work with her other images in an exciting first retrospective. In the fashion work, her models are studious and disengaged, often turned away or intentionally blurred themselves transformed to a compositional element. Images of animals, portraits, still lifes, and wonderful landscapes both rural and urban fill out her oeuvre. In her black-and-white images, Moon (also a filmmaker) masterfully tends the edges of darkness where the merest hints of light create detail, texture, and form. Her tasty color work is highly saturated and grainy. Innovative, witty, and seductive, Moon's photographs draw the viewer into a dream world, at once soothing and vaguely troubled like the opening of a storm. Everything a great art book should be, this volume makes apparent Moon's original contribution to photography over the last 30 years. Highly recommended for large public and academic photographic departments, the book may be of special interest to clothing design/fashion collections.

The first half of the book is a group of stories first published in 1912. Mrs. Spring Fragrance is a Chinese woman transplanted to Seattle who both pleases and perplexes her Chinese husband by becoming ``Americanized.'' Many of Far's characters are caught in the bewildering expanse between Chinese and white communities. In ``Its Wavering Image,'' a white reporter courts a woman who is the child of a white woman and a Chinese man, insisting, ``You are a white woman--white. Did your kiss not promise me that?'' ``The Story of One White Woman Who Married a Chinese'' follows its protagonist through two marriages, first to an abusive white man who, though he talks about writing a book on social reform and suffrage, derides her as stupid, then to a Chinese man for whom she does embroidery. The latter part of the book contains a few uncollected short stories, but consists mostly of articles Far wrote about the Chinese community. One chronicles the fate of ``Half-Chinese Children,'' while another gives a straightforward account of the customs ``In Los Angeles' Chinatown.'' There is a dignified, formal quality to Far's writing that helps capture a moment. This collection is a fine tribute to one of the brave early mothers of multiculturalism. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Second Epistle of Peter and the Epistle of Jude: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale New Testament Commentaries)</h2><p>Green&#39;s study of 2 Peter and Jude constitutes one volume in the Tyndale New Testament Commentaries, a popular series designed to help the general Bible reader understand clearly what the text actually says and what it means, without undue recourse to scholarly technicalities.</p><p></p><h2>The Garden of Eden and Other Criminal Delights</h2><p>Fourteen short crime tales feature the partnership of Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus and include three previously unpublished works, as well as two essays drawn from the author&#39;s personal life, in a collection that includes &#34;The Garden of Eden,&#34; &#34;Bull&#39;s Eye,&#34; &#34;A Woman of Mystery,&#34; and &#34;Mummy and Jack.&#34; 100,000 first printing.</p><p>Faye Kellerman is the author of the bestselling Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus novels, as well as a thriller, Moon Music, and a historical novel, The Quality of Mercy.

Two of the stories feature Kellerman's well-known husband-and-wife sleuths, LAPD Lt. Peter Drucker and his wife, Rina Lazarus. In another story, "The Luck of the Draw," there are revelations about what happens to a family that wins the lottery. The story, which Kellerman wrote with her two young daughters, is given a raucous interpretation by Lindsay Crouse and Nancy McKeon. The outstanding chiller, written by Kellerman with her son, a playwright, combines family and evil.

Which means the party of German computer executives that Kate and her colleagues are looking after will be lucky to go home with any money at all. More interested in firing off their expensive guns than in the sport of hunting moose, these guys are a danger to themselves and anyone else within range.

She has instructed classes in skin-sewing and basket-weaving at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks for over twenty years.<b>Once Upon An Eskimo Time</b> is the tale of the tenth year in the life of Nedercook as told to her daughter, Edna Wilder. Nedercook's narrative begins in the spring at the end of "the cold, dark days of winter." While her descriptions of the Bering Sea and surrounding land on the Seward Peninsula are filled with beautifully crafted prose, the dialogue portrays a people whose lives are dictated by thought directly related to action: "Today we go on big hunt." "Son needs help." "Young be happy." "Big storm come." Nedercook's delicately rendered descriptions tell of events, ceremonies, and details in the daily life of people from the far north. This is a land where every day's weather determines what each person will do to find, cook, and store food; where the people will relieve themselves; where the moss used for personal hygiene, menstruating women, and baby diapers will be found; what will be wrapped around the newborns who, within hours of birth, are strapped to their mothers' backs. Interwoven with these particulars of daily life are the ancient legends, told to Nedercook by her parents with the delightful requirement that she herself tell them again and again until she gets them right. This story of one year in a young Eskimo girl's life is a powerful and tender tribute to some of America's first peoples. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>Rupture: An Ari Thor Thriller (The Dark Iceland Series, 4)</h2><p><p><b>A huge bestseller in England, France, and Australia, the fourth book in the Ari Thor thriller series from a spectacular new crime writer. </b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Hailed for combining the darkness of Nordic Noir with classic mystery writing, author Ragnar Jonasson&#x2019;s books are haunting, atmospheric, and complex.<i> Rupture</i>, the latest Ari Th�r thriller, delivers another dark mystery that is chillingly stunning with its complexity and fluidity.</p><p>Young policeman Ari Th�r tries to solve a 50-year-old murder when new evidence surfaces.

Sun Tzu explains when and how to engage opponents in order to prevail in difficult situations. Instead of describing the logistics of warfare, he shows the reader how to succeed by motivating soldiers and leveraging tactical advantages. In short, he explains how to win the battle of wits. Though it was written for the battlefield, The Art of War contains valuable advice for other endeavors as well. Tzu&#39;s work has been lauded by sports coaches, business executives, and other leaders of the 21st century. This edition contains the translation of Lionel Giles, widely considered the most faithful and authoritative translation.</p><p><i>The Art of War</i> was written over 2,300 years ago in what is now North China. Yet it still remains a contemporary lesson on how to attain victory without going to battle. Modern-day warriors find its ancient strategies helpful regardless of whether the conflict dwells in the boardroom or the bedroom. Despite numerous references to enemies, generals, and armies, <i>The Art of War</i> is about nonaggression. At its core, <i>The Art of War</i> offers a sophisticated lesson on "taking whole," meaning staying openhearted and relaxed in order to sidestep a fight--whether you are a field commander, a CEO, or a frustrated mother putting a resistant son to bed. This particular translation comes from the Denma Translation Group, led by scholars Kidder Smith and James Gimian (publisher of <i>Shambhala Sun</i> magazine). Because of the text's obscure wording (even the Chinese find the original document cumbersome), the translators have inserted helpful commentary that removes some of the linguistic barriers. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war.

Isolated and secure, overlooking the luxurious French Riviera, the residents lack nothing. Yet one day Dr. Greenwood from Eden-Olympia's clinic goes on a suicidal shooting spree. Dr. Jane Sinclair is hired as his replacement, and she and her husband, Paul, are given Dr. Greenwood's house as a residence. <br><br>Unable to work while recovering from an accident, Paul spends his days taking a<br>close look at the house where Dr. Greenwood shot himself and three hostages. He discovers clues in the house lead him to question Eden-Olympia's official account of the killings. Drawn into investigating the activities of the park's leading citizens, while Jane is lured deeper into Eden-Olympia's inner workings, Paul uncovers the dangerous psychological vents that maintain Eden-Olympia's smoothly running surface. An experiment is underway at Eden-Olympia, an experiment in power and brutality. Soon Paul finds himself in race to save himself and his wife before they are crushed by forces that may be beyond anyone's control. <br></p><p>J. G. Ballard is the author of numerous books, including <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, <i>Crash</i>, <i>Concrete Island</i> and <i>The Kindness of Women</i>. He is revered as one of the most important writers of fiction to address the consequences of twentieth-century technology. He lives in England.<br>Chapter One&nbsp;The first person I met at Eden-Olympia was a psychiatrist, and in many ways it seems only too apt that my guide to this `intelligent' city in the hills above Cannes should have been a specialist in mental disorders. I realize now that a kind of waiting madness, like a state of undeclared war, haunted the office buildings of the business park. For most of us, Dr Wilder Penrose was our amiable Prospero, the psychopomp who steered our darkest dreams towards the daylight. I remember his eager smile when we greeted each other, and the evasive eyes that warned me away from his outstretched hand. Only when I learned to admire this flawed and dangerous man was I able to think of killing him.<br><br>Rather than fly from London to Nice, a journey as brief as a plastic-tray lunch, Jane and I decided to drive to the Cote d'Azur and steal a few last days of freedom before we committed ourselves to Eden-Olympia and the disciplines of the Euro-corporate lifestyle. Jane was still unsure about her six-month secondment to the business park's private clinic. Her predecessor, a young English doctor named David Greenwood, had met a tragic and still unexplained death after running amok with a rifle. By chance, Jane had known Greenwood when they worked together at Guy's Hospital, and I often thought of the boyishly handsome doctor who could rouse an entire women's ward with a single smile.<br>Memories of Greenwood were waiting for us at Boulogne as the<br>Jaguar left the cross-Channel ferry and rolled its wheels across the quayside. Going into a tabac for a packet of Gitanes - illicit cigarettes had kept both of us sane during my months in hospital Jane bought a copy of <i>Paris Match</i> and found Greenwood's face on the cover, under a headline that referred to the unsolved mystery. As she sat alone on the Jaguar's bonnet, staring at the graphic photographs of murder victims and the grainy maps of the death route, I realized that my spunky but insecure young wife needed to put a few more miles between herself and Eden-Olympia.<br>Rather than overheat either Jane's imagination or the Jaguar's elderly engine, I decided to avoid the Autoroute du Soleil and take the RN7. We bypassed Paris on the Peripherique, and spent our first evening at a venerable hotel in the forest near Fontainebleau, spelling out the attractions of Eden-Olympia to each other and trying not to notice the antique hunting rifle on the dining-room mantelpiece.<br><br>The next day we crossed the olive line, following the long, cicada miles that my mother and father had motored when they first took me to the Mediterranean as a boy. Surprisingly, many of the old landmarks were still there, the family restaurants and literate bookshops, and the light airfields with their casually parked planes that had first made me decide to become a pilot.<br><br>Trying to distract Jane, I talked far too much. During the few months of our marriage I had told my doctor-bride almost nothing about myself, and the drive became a mobile autobiography that unwound my earlier life along with the kilometres of dust, insects and sun. My parents had been dead for two decades, but I wanted Jane to meet them, my hard-drinking, womanizing father, a provincial-circuit barrister, and my lonely, daydreaming mother, always getting over yet another doomed affair.<br><br>At a hotel in Hauterives, south of Lyons, Jane and I sat in the same high-ceilinged breakfast room, unchanged after thirty-five years, where the stags' heads still gazed over shelves stocked with the least enticing alcohol I had ever seen. My parents, after their usual bickering breakfast of croissants and coffee helped down by slugs of cognac, had dragged me off to the dream palace of the Facteur Cheval, a magical edifice conjured out of pebbles the old postman collected on his rounds. Working tirelessly for thirty years, he created an heroic doll's house that expressed his simple but dignified dreams of the earthly paradise. My mother tipsily climbed the miniature stairs, listening to my father declaim the postman's naive verses in his resonant baritone. All I could think of, with a ten-year-olds curiosity about my parents' sex-lives, was what had passed between them during the night. Now, as I embraced Jane on the parapets of the dream palace, I realized that I would never know.<br><br>Cheval might have survived, but the France of the 1960s, with its Routier lunches, anti-CRS slogans and the Citroen DS, had been largely replaced by a new France of high-speed monorails, MacDo's, and the lavish air-shows that my cousin Charles and I would visit in our rented Cessna when we founded our firm of aviation publishers. And Eden-Olympia was the newest of the new France. Ten miles to the north-east of Cannes, in the wooded hills between Valbonne and the coast, it was the latest of the development zones that had begun with Sophia-Antipohs and would soon turn Provence into Europe's silicon valley.<br><br>Lured by tax concessions and a climate like northern California's, dozens of multinational companies had moved into the business park that now employed over ten thousand people. The senior managements were the most highly paid professional caste in Europe, a new elite of administrators, <i>enarques</i> and scientific entrepreneurs. The lavish brochure enthused over a vision of glass and titanium straight from the drawing boards of Richard Neutra and Frank Gehry, but softened by landscaped parks and artificial lakes, a humane version of Corbusier's radiant city. Even my sceptical eye was prepared to blink.<br><br>Studying the maps, I propped the brochure on my knee-brace as Jane steered the Jaguar through the afternoon traffic on the Grasse road. The stench of raw perfume from a nearby factory filled the car, but Jane wound down her window and inhaled deeply. Our disreputable evening in Arles had revived her, swaying arm in arm with me after a drunken dinner, exploring what I insisted was Van Gogh's canal but turned out to be a stagnant storm-drain behind the archbishop's palace. We had both been eager to get back to our hotel and the well-upholstered bed.<br>The colour was returning to her face, for almost the first time since our wedding. Her watchful eyes and toneless skin were like those of an over-gifted child. Before meeting me, Jane had spent too many hours in elevators and pathology rooms, and the pallor of strip lighting haunted her like a twelve-year-olds memories of a bad dream. But once we left Arles she rose to the challenge of Eden-Olympia, and I could hear her muttering to herself, rehearsing the risque backchat that so intrigued the younger consultants at Guy's.<br><br>`Cheer me up, Paul. How much further?'<br>`The last mile - always the shortest one. You must be tired.'<br><br>`It's been a lot of fun, more than I thought. Why do I feel so nervous?'<br><br>`You don't.' I pressed her hand against the wheel, steering the Jaguar around an elderly woman cyclist, panniers filled with baguettes. Jane, you'll be a huge success. You're the youngest doctor on the staff, and the prettiest. You're efficient, hardworking . . . what else?'<br><br>`Slightly insolent?'<br>`You'll do them good. Anyway, it's only a business park.'<br><br>`I can see it - straight ahead. My God, it's the size of Florida . . .'<br><br>The first office buildings in the Eden-Olympia complex were emerging from the slopes of along valley filled with eucalyptus trees and umbrella pines. Beyond them were the rooftops of Cannes and the Iles de Lerins, a glimpse of the Mediterranean that never failed to lift my heart.<br><br>`Paul, down there . . .' Jane pointed to the hillside, raising a<br>finger still grimy from changing a spark plug. Hundreds of blue ovals trembled like damaged retinas in the Proven~al sun. `What are they rain-traps? Tanks full of Chanel Number S? And those people. They seem to be naked.'<br><br>`They are naked. Or nearly. Swimming pools, Jane. Take a good look at your new patients.' I watched one senior executive in the garden of his villa, a suntanned man in his fifties with a slim, almost adolescent body, springing lightly on his diving board. `A healthy crowd . . . I can't imagine anyone here actually bothering to fall ill.'<br><br>`Don't be too sure. I'll be busier than you think. The place is probably riddled with airport TB and the kind of viruses that only breed in executive jets. And as for their minds . . .'<br><br>I began to count the pools, each a flare of turquoise light lost behind the high walls of the villas with their screens of cycads and bougainvillaea. Ten thousand years in the future, long after the Cote d'Azur had been abandoned, the first explorers would puzzle over these empty pits, with their eroded frescoes of tritons and stylized fish, inexplicably hauled up the mountainsides like aquatic sundials or the altars of a bizarre religion devised by a race of visionary geometers.<br><br>We left the Cannes road and turned onto a landscaped avenue that led towards the gates of the business park. The noise from the Jaguar's tyres fell away as they rolled across a more expensive surface material milled ivory, at the very least - that would soothe the stressed wheels of the stretch limousines. A palisade of Canary palms formed an honour guard along the verges, while beds of golden canvas flamed from the central reservation.<br><br>Despite this gaudy welcome, wealth at Eden-Olympia displayed the old-money discretion that the mercantile rich of the information age had decided to observe at the start of a new millennium. The glass and gunmetal office blocks were set well apart from each other, separated by artificial lakes and forested traffic islands where a latter-day Crusoe could have found comfortable<br>refuge. The faint mist over the lakes and the warm sun reflected from the glass curtain-walling seemed to generate an opal haze, as if the entire business park were a mirage, a virtual city conjured into the pine-scented air like a <i>son-et-lumiere</i> vision of a new Versailles.<br>But work and the realities of corporate life anchored Eden-Olymp...</p><h2>Dictator (Book Three) (Cicero Trilogy)</h2><p><b>The concluding part of the Cicero Trilogy that began with <i>Imperium</i>, from the No. 1 bestselling author of <i>Fatherland, An officer and a Spy, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii</i> and <i>The Ghost</i>.</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aged 48, Marcus Cicero, the greatest orator of his time, is to all appearances a broken man. Out of power, exiled to the eastern Mediterranean with his faithful secretary, Tiro, separated from his wife and children, his possessions confiscated, he spends his days tormented by his failure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, to quote one of his own famous aphorisms: 'while there's life there's hope'. By promising to support his political enemy, Caesar, he manages to win his return to Italy. Once home, he gradually fights his way back: first in the law courts, then in the senate, and finally by the power of his pen, until at last, for one brief and glorious period, he is once again the dominant figure in Rome.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-awaited final volume of Robert Harris's Cicero Trilogy, <i>Dictator </i>encompasses some of the most epic events in human history: the collapse of the Roman republic, the subsequent civil war, the murder of Pompey and the assassination of Julius Caesar. Its theme, however, is timeless: how is political freedom to be safeguarded against the triple threats of unscrupulous personal ambition, of an electoral system dominated by vested financial interests, and of the corrupting impact of waging ceaseless foreign wars?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But above all, it is the very human figure of Cicero, beset by family problems, which makes the story so compelling: brilliant, flawed, frequently fearful and yet ultimately brave -- a hero for his time, and for ours.</p><p>ROBERT HARRIS is the author of <i>An Officer and a Spy, Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, Lustrum</i>, and <i>The Ghost</i>, all of which were international bestsellers. His work has been translated into thirty-seven languages. After graduating with a degree in English from Cambridge University, he worked as a reporter for the BBC's Panorama and Newsnight programmes, before becoming political editor of the <i>Observer</i> and subsequently a columnist on the <i>Sunday Times </i>and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. He is married to Gill Hornby and they live with their four children in a village near Hungerford.I<br><br>I remember the cries of caesar&#x2019;s war-horns chasing us over the darkened fields of Latium&#x2014;their yearning, keening howls, like animals in heat&#x2014;and how when they stopped there was only the slither of our shoes on the icy road and the urgent panting of our breath.<br><br>It was not enough for the immortal gods that Cicero should be spat at and reviled by his fellow citizens; not enough that in the middle of the night he be driven from the hearths and altars of his family and ancestors; not enough even that as we fled from Rome on foot he should look back and see his house in flames. To all these torments they deemed it necessary to add one further refinement: that he should be forced to hear his enemy&#x2019;s army striking camp on the Field of Mars.<br><br>Even though he was the oldest of our party Cicero kept up the same fast pace as the rest of us. Not long ago he had held Caesar&#x2019;s life in the palm of his hand. He could have crushed it as easily as an egg. Now their fortunes led them in entirely opposite directions. While Cicero hurried south to escape his enemies, the architect of his destruction marched north to take command of both provinces of Gaul.<br><br>He walked with his head down, not uttering a word and I imagined it was because he was too full of despair to speak. Only at dawn, when we rendezvoused with our horses at Bovillae and were about to embark on the second stage of our escape, did he pause with his foot in the doorway of his carriage and say suddenly, &#x201c;Do you think we should turn back?&#x201d;<br><br>The question caught me by surprise. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t considered it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, consider it now. Tell me: why are we fleeing Rome?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why is Clodius so powerful?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s a tribune and can pass laws against you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who made it possible for him to become a tribune?&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated. &#x201c;Caesar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Caesar. Do you imagine that man&#x2019;s departure for Gaul at that precise hour was a coincidence? Of course not! He waited till his spies had reported I&#x2019;d left the city before ordering his army to move. Why? I&#x2019;d always assumed his advancement of Clodius was to punish me for speaking out against him. But what if his real aim all along was to drive me out of Rome? What scheme requires him to be certain I&#x2019;ve gone before he can leave too?&#x201d;<br><br>I should have grasped the logic of what he was saying. I should have urged him to turn back. But I was too exhausted to reason clearly. And if I am honest there was more to it than that. I was too afraid of what Clodius&#x2019;s thugs might do to us if they caught us re-entering the city.<br><br>So instead I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good question, and I can&#x2019;t pretend I have the answer. But wouldn&#x2019;t it look indecisive, after bidding goodbye to everyone, suddenly to reappear? In any case, Clodius has burned your house down now&#x2014;where would we return to? Who would take us in? I think you&#x2019;d be wiser to stick to your original plan and get as far away from Rome as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>He rested his head against the side of the carriage and closed his eyes. In the pale grey light I was shocked by how haggard he appeared after his night on the road. His hair and beard had not been cut for weeks. He was wearing a toga dyed black. Although he was only in his forty-ninth year, these public signs of mourning made him look much older&#x2014;like some ancient, mendicant holy man. After a while he sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Tiro. Perhaps you&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s so long since I slept I&#x2019;m too tired to think any more.&#x201d;<br><br>And so the fatal error was made&#x2014;more through indecision than decision&#x2014;and we continued to press on southwards for the remainder of that day and for the twelve days that followed, putting what we thought was a safe distance between ourselves and danger.<br><br>We travelled with a minimal entourage to avoid attracting attention&#x2014;just the carriage driver and three armed slaves on horseback, one in front and two behind. A small chest of gold and silver coins that Atticus, Cicero&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, had provided to pay for our journey was hidden under our seat. We stayed only in the houses of men we trusted, no more than a night in each, and steered clear of those places where Cicero might have been expected to stop&#x2014;for example at his seaside villa at Formiae, the first place any pursuers would look for him, and along the Bay of Naples, already filling with the annual exodus from Rome in search of winter sun and warm springs. Instead we headed as fast as we could towards the toe of Italy.<br><br>Cicero&#x2019;s plan, conceived on the move, was to make for Sicily and stay there until the political agitation against him in Rome subsided. &#x201c;The mob will turn on Clodius eventually,&#x201d; he predicted. &#x201c;Such is the unalterable nature of the mob. He will always be my mortal enemy but he won&#x2019;t always be tribune&#x2014;we must never forget that. In nine months his term of office will expire and then we can go back.&#x201d;<br><br>He was confident of a friendly reception from the Sicilians, if only because of his successful prosecution of the island&#x2019;s tyrannical governor, Verres&#x2014;even though that brilliant victory, which launched his political career, was now twelve years in the past and Clodius had more recently been a magistrate in the province. I sent letters ahead giving notice of his intention to seek sanctuary, and when we reached the harbour at Regium we hired a little six-oared boat to row us across the straits to Messina.<br><br>We left the harbour on a clear cold winter morning of searing blues&#x2014;the sea and the sky; one light, one dark; the line dividing them as sharp as a blade; the distance to Messina a mere three miles. It took us less than an hour. We drew so close we could see Cicero&#x2019;s supporters lined up on the rocks to welcome him. But stationed between us and the entrance to the port was a warship flying the red and green colours of the governor of Sicily, Gaius Vergilius, and as we approached the lighthouse it slipped its anchor and moved slowly forwards to intercept us. Vergilius stood at the rail surrounded by his lictors and, after visibly recoiling at Cicero&#x2019;s dishevelled appearance, shouted down a greeting, to which Cicero replied in friendly terms. They had known one another in the Senate for many years.<br><br>Vergilius asked him his intentions.<br><br>Cicero called back that naturally he intended to come ashore.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d heard,&#x201d; replied Vergilius. &#x201c;Unhappily I can&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius&#x2019;s new law.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what new law would that be? There are so many, one loses count.&#x201d;<br><br>Vergilius beckoned to a member of his staff who produced a document and leaned down to pass it to me and I then gave it to Cicero. To this day I can remember how it fluttered in his hands in the slight breeze as if it were a living thing; it was the only sound in the silence. He took his time and when he had finished reading it he handed it to me without comment.<br><br>Lex Clodia in Ciceronem<br><br>Whereas M. T. Cicero has put Roman citizens to death unheard and uncondemned; and to that end forged the authority and decree of the Senate; it is hereby ordained that he be interdicted from fire and water to a distance of four hundred miles from Rome; that nobody should presume to harbour or receive him, on pain of death; that all his property and possessions be forfeit; that his house in Rome be demolished and a shrine to Liberty consecrated in its place; and that whoever shall move, speak, vote or take any step towards recalling him shall be treated as a public enemy, unless those whom Cicero unlawfully put to death should first spring back to life.<br><br>It must have been the most terrible blow. But he found the composure to dismiss it with a flick of his hand. &#x201c;When,&#x201d; he enquired, &#x201c;was this nonsense published?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m told it was posted in Rome eight days ago. It came into my hands yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s not law yet, and can&#x2019;t be law until it&#x2019;s been read a third time. My secretary will confirm it. Tiro,&#x201d; he said, turning to me, &#x201c;tell the governor the earliest date it can be passed.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to calculate. Before a bill could be put to a vote it had to be read aloud in the Forum on three successive market days. But my reasoning was so shaken by what I had just read I couldn&#x2019;t remember what day of the week it was now, let alone when the market days fell. &#x201c;Twenty days from today,&#x201d; I hazarded, &#x201c;perhaps twenty-five?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; cried Cicero. &#x201c;I have three weeks&#x2019; grace even if it passes, which I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He stood up in the prow of the boat, bracing his legs against the rocking of the hull, and spread his arms wide in appeal. &#x201c;Please, my dear Vergilius, for the sake of our past friendship, now that I have come so far, at least allow me to land and spend a night or two with my supporters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, as I say, I&#x2019;m sorry, but I cannot take the risk. I&#x2019;ve consulted my experts. They say even if you travelled to the very western tip of the island, to Lilybaeum, you&#x2019;d still be within three hundred and fifty miles of Rome, and then Clodius would come after me.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, Cicero ceased to be so friendly. He said coldly, &#x201c;You have no right under the law to impede the journey of a Roman citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have every right to safeguard the tranquillity of my province. And here, as you know, my word is the law . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He was apologetic. I dare say he was even embarrassed. But he was immovable, and after a few more angry exchanges there was nothing for it but to turn round and row back to Regium. Our departure provoked a great cry of dismay from the shoreline and I could see that Cicero for the first time was seriously worried. Vergilius was a friend of his. If this was how a friend reacted then soon the whole of Italy would be closed against him. Returning to Rome to oppose the law was much too risky. He had left it too late. Apart from the physical danger such a journey would entail, the bill would almost certainly pass, and then we would be stranded four hundred miles from the legal limit it prescribed. To comply safely with the terms of his exile he would have to flee abroad immediately. Obviously Gaul was out of the question because of Caesar. So it would have to be somewhere in the East&#x2014;Greece perhaps, or Asia. But unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the peninsula to make our escape in the treacherous winter seas. We needed to get over to the opposite coast, to Brundisium on the Adriatic, and find a big ship capable of making a lengthy voyage. Our predicament was exquisitely vile&#x2014;as no doubt Caesar, the original sponsor and creator of Clodius, had intended.<br><br>it took us two weeks of arduous travel to cross the mountains, often in heavy rain and mostly along bad roads. Every mile seemed fraught with the hazard of ambush, although the primi�tive little towns we passed through were welcoming enough. At night we slept in smoky, freezing inns and dined on hard bread and fatty meat made scarcely more palatable by sour wine. Cicero&#x2019;s mood veered between fury and despair. He saw clearly now that he had made a terrible mistake by leaving Rome. It had been madness for him to quit the city and leave Clodius free to spread the calumny that he had put citizens to death &#x201c;unheard and uncondemned&#x201d; when in fact each of the five Catiline conspirators had been allowed to speak in his own defence and their execution had been sanctioned by the entire Senate. But his flight was tantamount to an admission of guilt. He should have obeyed his instinct and turned back when he heard Caesar&#x2019;s departing trumpets and first began to realise his error. He wept at the disaster his folly and timidity had brought upon his wife and children.<br><br>And when he had finished lashing himself, he turned his scourge on Hortensius &#x201c;and the rest of the aristocratic gang,&#x201d; who had never forgiven him for rising from his humble origins to the consulship and saving the republic: they had deliberately urged him to flee in order to ruin him. He should have heeded the example of Socrates, who said that death was preferable to exile. Yes, he should have killed himself! He snatched up a knife from the dining table. He would kill himself! I said nothing. I didn&#x2019;t take the threat seriously. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the sight of others&#x2019; blood, let alone his own. All his life he had tried to avoid military expeditions, the games, public executions, funerals&#x2014;anything that might remind him of mortality. If pain frightened him, death terrified him&#x2014;which, although I would never have been impertinent enough to point it out, was the principal reason we had fled Rome in the first place.<br><br>When finally we came within sight of the fortified walls of Brundisium, he decided not to venture inside. The port was so large and busy, so full of strangers, and so likely to be his desti�n�ation, he was convinced it was the obvious spot for his assassination. Instead we sought sanctuary a little way up the coast, in the residence of his old friend Marcus Laenius Flaccus. That night we slept in decent beds for the first time in three weeks, and the next morning we went down to the beach. The waves were much rougher than on the Sicilian side. A strong wind was hurling the Adriatic relentlessly against the rocks and shingle. Cicero loathed sea voyages at the best of times; this one promised to be especially treacherous. Yet it was our only means of escape. One hundred and twenty miles beyond the horizon lay the shore of Illyricum.<br><br>Flaccus, noticing his expression, said, &#x201c;Fortify your spirits, Cicero&#x2014;perhaps the bill won&#x2019;t pass, or one of the other tribunes will veto it. There must be someone left in Rome willing to stand up for you&#x2014;Pompey, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>But Cicero, his gaze still fixed out to sea, made no reply, and a few days later we heard that the bill had indeed become law and that Flaccus was therefore guilty of a capital offence simply by having a convicted exile on his premises. Even so he tried to persuade us to stay. He insisted that Clodius didn&#x2019;t frighten him. But Cicero wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it: &#x201c;Your loyalty moves me, old friend, but that monster will have dispatched a team of his hired fighters to hunt me down the moment his law passed. There is no time to lose.&#x201d;<br><br>I had found a merchant ship in the harbour at Brundisium whose hard-pressed master was willing to risk a winter voyage across the Adriatic in return for a huge fee, and the next morning at first light, when no one was around, we went on board. She was a sturdy, broad-beamed vessel, with a crew of about twenty, used to ply the trade route between Italy and Dyrrachium. I was no judge of these things, but she looked safe enough to me. The master estimated the crossing would require a day and a half&#x2014;but we needed to leave quickly, he said, and take advantage of the favourable wind. So while the sailors made her ready and Flaccus waited on the quayside, Cicero quickly dictated a final message to his wife and children: It has been a fine life, a great career&#x2014;the good in me, nothing bad, has brought me down. My dear Terentia, loyalest and best of wives, my darling daughter Tullia, and little Marcus, our one remaining hope&#x2014;goodbye! I copied it out and passed it up to Flaccus. He raised his hand in farewell. Then the sail was unfurled, the cables cast off, the oarsmen pushed us away from the harbour wall, and we set off into the pale grey light.<br><br>at first we made good speed. cicero stood high above the deck on the steersmen&#x2019;s platform, leaning on the stern rail, watching the great lighthouse of Brundisium recede behind us. Apart from his visits to Sicily, it was the first time he had left Italy since his youth, when he went to Rhodes to learn oratory from Molon.

After suffering under a tyrannous pure democracy that had the power to create laws so fast that no thought could be given to the effects, the sentients of the galaxy found a need for the Bureau of Sabotage (BuSab) to slow the wheels of government, thereby preventing it from legislating recklessly.In Whipping Star, Jorj X. McKie, a &#34;Saboteur Extraordinary,&#34; is a born troublemaker who has naturally become one of BuSab&#39;s best agents. As the novel opens, it is revealed that Calebans, who are beings visible to other sentient species as stars, have been disappearing one by one. Each disappearance is accompanied by millions of sentient deaths and instances of incurable insanity.Ninety years prior to the setting of Whipping Star, the Calebans appeared and offered jump-doors to the collective species, allowing sentients to travel instantly to any point in the universe. Gratefully accepting, the sentiency didn&#39;t question the consequences. Now Mliss Abnethe, a psychotic human female with immense power and wealth, has bound a Caleban in a contract that allows the Caleban to be whipped to death; when the Caleban dies, everyone who has ever used a jump-door (which is almost every adult in the sentient world and many of the young) will die as well.The Calebans have attempted to remedy the error, but Mliss Abnethe refuses to cancel the contract, and the Caleban sense of honor makes breaking the contract from their side unthinkable. To save themselves, all the Calebans are handing over the time-like history lines of the sentients who used jump-doors to one Caleban, Fannie Mae, and withdrawing from ConSentiency space. McKie has to find Mliss and stop her before Fannie Mae reaches, in her words, &#34;ultimate discontinuity,&#34; but he is constrained by the law protecting private individuals by restricting the ministrations of BuSab to public entities.</p><p>Frank Herbert&#39;s speculative fictions have taken the grand themes and questions of politics, ecology, overpopulation, and much more and applied them to the human drama. His most popular works are the well-known Dune books: Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, and the extraordinary bestseller God Emperor of Dune. He wrote more than twenty other works of fiction and nonfiction, including a book on home computers, before his death in 1986.

Oliver Twist's famous cry of the heart has resounded with readers since the novel's initial appearance in 1837, and the book remains a popular favorite with fans of all ages.<br>Dickens was no stranger to the pain of hunger and the degradation of poverty. He poured his own youthful experience of Victorian London's unspeakable squalor into this realistic depiction of the link between destitution and crime. Oliver escapes his miserable servitude by running away to London, where he unwillingly but inevitably joins a scabrous gang of thieves. Masterminded by the loathsome Fagin, the underworld crew features some of Dickens' most memorable characters, including the juvenile pickpocket known as the Artful Dodger, the vicious Bill Sikes, and gentle Nancy, an angel of self-sacrifice.<br>A profound social critic, Dickens introduced genteel readers to the problems of the poor in a way that had rarely been attempted before.

Hermione has pulled together a select gathering to celebrate Winston Churchill's 39th birthday. Some of the oldest families in the country have gathered to toast the dangerously ambitious and utterly charming First Lord of the Admiralty. But when the dinner ends, one of the gentlemen remains seated at the table, head down among the walnut shells littering the cloth and a knife between his ribs.</p><p>Summoned from Iyntwood, Mrs. Jackson helps her mistress trace the steps of suspects both upstairs and downstairs as Hermione's household prepares to host a highly anticipated charity event. Determined to get to the bottom of things, Lady Montfort and Mrs. Jackson unravel the web of secrecy surrounding the bright whirlwind of London society, investigating the rich, well-connected and seeming do-gooders in a race against time to stop the murderer from striking again.</p></p><p>TESSA ARLEN&nbsp;is the author of the Lady Montfort mystery series set in the early 1900s.&nbsp;She is the daughter of a British diplomat, and had lived in or visited her parents in Singapore, Berlin, the Persian Gulf, Beijing, Delhi and Warsaw by the time she was sixteen.

Such considerations give Moltmann's treatment of the different aspects of life in Spirit a verve and vitality that are concrete and existential:<br>"When I love God I love the beauty of bodies, the rhythm of movements, the shining of eyes, the embraces, the feelings, the scents, the sounds of all this protean creation . . . The experience of God deepens the experiences of life . . . It awakens the unconditional Yes to life."<br>Part One probes "Experiences of the Spirit" in daily life as well as in biblical and theological traditions. In Part Two Moltmann takes up the roles of the Spirit in the order of salvation under the aegis "Life in the Spirit". And Part Three concludes the volume with discussions of "The Fellowship and Person of the Spirit".<br>Veteran readers of Moltmann will find here a rich and subtle extension of his trinitarian and christological works, even as he makes bold use of key insights from feminist and ecological theologies, from recent stress on embodiment, and from charismatic movements. Newer readers will find a fascinating entree into the heart of Moltmann's work: the transformative potential of the future.<br>In an age of planetary peril, in a culture often hostile to human, animal, and plant life, Moltmann's emphatic insistence on the Spirit is a clear call to conscience: The one indispensable element for human survival, he asserts, is an "unconditional affirmation of life" quickened by the Spirit.</p><p>J�rgen Moltmann is Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of T�bingen, Germany.

Here, in countless public squares and cemeteries, are monuments to the battles of the Revolution, and memorials to the heirs of the revolutionaries who themselves marched off to preserve the Union during the Civil War.<br><br> One of the most splendid repositories of American institutional architecture is found in New England's public meeting halls and churches, and in the industrial mills and factories of the nineteenth century. The book also celebrates New England's rich tradition of domestic architecture: seaside homes clad in weathered gray shingles, white clapboard houses surrounding village greens, and exuberant Victorian gingerbread homes. New England is justly famous for its succession of intensely realized seasons: its deep and snowy winter; its spring, which bursts forth in a cascade of melting snow and budding vegetation; its leafy, languid summer days; and, perhaps most famously, its autumn, when the landscape seems to be on fire with the vivid reds, oranges, and yellows of the foliage.<br><br><em>The Most Beautiful Villages of New England</em> presents over twenty-five towns and villages, chosen for their beauty and history, and for their diverse geography. Here are the fishing villages and towns of New England's rocky Atlantic Coast, from famous summer watering holes to isolated island hamlets. We explore farming villages and the highlands of New England's mountain ranges--the Adirondacks, Berkshires, and Green Mountains. In the river valleys we find quiet, exquisitely preserved communities and renovated mill and factory towns.

From his early days as a Naval Aviation Cadet he had a knack for flying but seemed to be in the neighborhood of disaster. Through two Korean combat tours, Navy test operations, his years as test pilot for North American Aviation, and the space program he was associated with many near and some real catastrophes.</p><p>First as a Navy combat pilot and later as an experimental test pilot, John Moore experienced adventures that are legendary in the aviation community. He is the flying fraternity's nine-lived cat with a knack for describing his adventures in a way that appeals to aviators, but is not overly technical. His story is salted with good humor and deeply emotional memories. A member of the exclusive band of naval carrier pilots, Moore has flown 104 aircraft types in military operations, testing and civilian aviation. But as he notes in the introduction, The Wrong Stuff is more about the people he met, and those he lost, along the way. The author choose The Wrong Stuff as his title because he "crashed a lot". Actually, he could have called his aviation memoir "The Right Stuff" because he's still here to tell these thrilling tales! The Wrong Stuff is "must" reading for all fans of aviation history and true-life adventure. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i>An aviation cadet during World War II, Moore finished training too late to see action then but made up for it with two tours of duty flying jets in Korea and a distinguished later career as a naval and civilian test pilot. He is eloquent on the number of things that can and, in the early days of jets, usually did go wrong in the air as well as on the virtues and vices of certain aircraft, the F7U Cutlass and the F8F Bearcat in particular, and he tells the story--one worthy of Monty Python--of experimentation in landing fighters with no landing gear on rubber flight decks and runways. His memoirs are breezy, anecdotal, and unrepentant about fighter pilots' traditional pursuit of wine, women, and song but also relay the story of mastering many suicidally dangerous skills and teaching them to others while remaining a loving husband and father--the story of a most deserving citizen of his country. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Hot Rod Hamster Monster Truck Mania!</h2><p>The award-winning, bestselling team Cynthia Lord and Derek Anderson are back with the best Hot Rod Hamster adventure yet: Monster Truck Mania!

This follow-up volume, with all-new routes, details a similar mix of walk-ups, snow climbs, scrambles, wilderness alpine routes, hard rock climbs, ice climbs, and strenuous mixed climbs, with one major addition: sport and crag climbs. There are routes here for climbers of all skill levels, making this an ideal guide for everyone from beginners looking for the easiest routes up the gentler Cascade peaks to advanced rock climbers looking for a fresh, new challenge.<br>Like the first volume, Volume II includes detailed approach and route descriptions, permit requirements, topo maps, and photos for each climb, plus information on first ascents, equipment, areas of caution, and special considerations for climbing in the Cascades.<br></p><p>When the authors of the first volume of <i>Selected Climbs in the Cascades</i> were choosing ascents to include in <i>Vol. II</i>, their criteria was simple: that the routes be fun and aesthetically outstanding. Nearly every climb in the book offers amazing views of snowfields, glacier-carved valleys, or craggy peaks shrouded in mist. And although there are technical climbs involving aids, grade V alpine ascents, and waterfall climbs rated WI5, these are balanced by easier routes that require nothing more than bouldering skills. This is not a collection of the most radical, derring-do challenges in the Cascades but rather climbs that are simply a blast. <p> <i>Vol. II</i> differs from <i>Vol. I</i> in that it includes not just alpine routes but sport climbs and crag climbs--great for folks who want to take their rock-gym skills outside. The book also rates the <i>approach</i> to each climb from the car, whether it be a 10-minute walk or a grueling, two-day hike to a frozen waterfall. It's a practical consideration, as some of the approaches are more physically demanding than the actual route. Climbs covered begin in the southern Cascades, dominated by volcanoes Hood, Adams, and Rainier, and move northward to Snoqualmie Pass, with its easily accessible sport climbs and occasionally tough alpine routes. The guide finally moves into the North Cascades. Here, the mountains lose their volcanic character and take on the glacial-carved ruggedness of spots like Forbidden Peak and Mount Fury. More than 500 glaciers dot the area, and serious alpinists will find plenty in this section to occupy them. </p><p> Anyone who climbs in the Pacific Northwest should find <i>Vol. II</i> useful, whether they prefer rock or ice. It's a good entry-level guide, though it's not a how-to-climb manual; get your climbing fundamentals down, then pick up a copy. <i>--Demian McLean</i></p><strong>JIM NELSON</strong>, a native Northwesterner, is a professional mountain guide, climber, and mountain-shop owner. He has spent more than thirty years climbing year-round in the Cascades, the past nineteen of those teaching, guiding, and advising on equipment.

Greenfield and the Fall of the Protestant Establishment</h2><p>Albert M. Greenfield (1887-1967), an ambitious immigrant outsider, was courted for his business acumen by mayors, senators, governors, and presidents, including Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. As this feisty Russian Jew built a business empire that encompassed real estate, stores (including Bonwit Teller and Tiffany's), hotels (including the Ben Franklin and the Bellevue-Stratford), banks, newspapers, transportation companies, and even the Loft Candy Corporation, he challenged the entrenched business elite. Greenfield was also instrumental in bringing both major political conventions to Philadelphia in 1948.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Outsider,</i> veteran journalist and best-selling author Dan Rottenberg deftly chronicles the astonishing rises, falls, and countless reinventions of this savvy businessman. Greenfield's power allowed him to cross social, religious, and ethnic boundaries with impunity. He alarmed Philadelphia's conservative business and social leaders-Christians and Jews alike-some of whom plotted his downfall.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this engaging account of Greenfield's fascinating life, Rottenberg demonstrates the extent to which one uniquely brilliant and energetic man pushed the boundaries of society's limitations on individual potential. <i>The Outsider </i>provides a microcosmic look at three twentieth-century upheavals: the rise of Jews as a crucial American business force, the decline of America's Protestant establishment, and the transformation of American cities.</p><p>The remarkable life of Albert M. Greenfield, a Jewish immigrant whose business empire helped shape Philadelphia and the United States in the twentieth century<br>Dan Rottenberg is the author of ten books, including <i>The Man Who Made Wall Street: Anthony J. Drexel and the Rise of Modern Finance</i>, and the founding editor of the Broad Street Review, an arts and culture website.</p><h2>Gowns by Adrian : The MGM Years 1928-1941</h2><p>From his earliest days working at the colossal movie studio MGM, at the young age of 24, Gilbert Adrian had a vision that would showcase a new era in costume design for the screen. So fresh were his ideas, so original were his designs, and so extraordinary the workmanship that Adrian quite rightly earned the elegant film credit sobriquet, "Gowns by Adrian." He was the first, if not the most publicized, of a Hollywood hybrid known as the costume designer/couturier.<br>Gowns by Adrian: The MGM Years, 1928-1941 is the first comprehensive look at this prodigiously talented designer in his glory years at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The result of more than 10 years of research, access to previously unavailable MGM personnel files, and containing many unpublished photographs and complete filmography, Gowns by Adrian brings us into the design studio and onto the sound stage and makes us privy to the everyday give-and-take between designer and star. For the reclusive Garbo, Adrian was the only designer who understood her wish to avoid revealing necklines or fur; Shearer was particular in another way: two versions of every dress were de rigeur before she would choose one of them; and Crawford, was there ever a star more demanding or more determined? As Adrian once exclaimed, "Who would have thought that my entire reputation as a designer would rest on Joan Crawford's shoulders!"</p><p>Howard Gutner has contributed to Theatrical Designers: An Annotated Bibliography and Entertainment Weekly&#39;s The 100 Greatest Stars of All Time.Any longtime Hollywood fan would readily agree that nothing succeeded like excess--especially in the movies of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. And much of that success, claims researcher-editor Gunter, was due not only to the skills of such stars as Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford but also to the genius of one little-known costume designer--Gilbert Adrian, or simply Adrian, as L.A. dubbed him. The book starts with Adrian's predilection for the arts--born of talented parents and educated at Parsons--and, from there, almost instantaneous stardom when he joined MGM in 1924. Stars mentioned and movies cited will be familiar to almost anyone, including Katharine Hepburn in <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>, Greta Garbo as <i>Mata Hari</i>, and the wacky and wonderful <i>Wizard of Oz</i>. Best yet are the photographs, mainly in black and white, that showcase memorable "still" moments and the elusive process of artistic creation.

Julie Moir Messervy lends her spiritual sensibility and sensual writing style to a book about gardening as an act of creating emotional space. Through meditative and hands-on exercises, garden design tips, anecdotes drawn from Messervys gardening experiences and those of her clients, students, and family, and thoroughly engaging prose, we come to realize that the creative process is both a personal journey and a method for giving life to our own gardens. Illustrated with Barbara M. Bergers evocative charcoal drawings of the gardens of dreams and the imagination. Julie Moir Messervy is a renowned landscape designer, prolific garden lecturer, and critically acclaimed author whose prior books include <i>Contemplative Gardens</i> and <i>The Inward Garden</i>. She has collaborated on numerous landscape design projects, including a new Music Garden in Boston with legendary musician Yo-Yo Ma. This project will be the subject of a documentary film that will open at the Venice Film Festival in Fall 1997, and will air on PBS in early 1998.</p><p>Written in a charming, warm voice, <i>The Magic Land</i> guides new gardeners in using their intuition to envision their dream garden. Touching on concepts such as vignettes and movement in the garden, the book works to awaken a sense of wonder about nature and the home so that people can have a sanctuary that's perfectly matched to their lifestyles. Readers are encouraged to make collages representing what their gardens might feel like and to collect pictures and information from magazines. Overall, the book's strength is in its wide coverage of planning out the green area around a home; its weakness is in its lack of new and in-depth information. The book includes practical advice for design, but what is said has been said before in <i>Sunset</i> or <i>Better Homes &amp; Garden</i> manuals, e.g., "Figure out where the sunny and shady parts of the garden are in the different seasons, where the land is boggy or dry ..." There's minimal information for those gardeners who simply want to grab the shovel and plant a fast low-maintenance garden or tailor a backyard for children, guests, or pet activities.<p> If you are a fairly experienced gardener who already owns a garden- design book, chances are you won't glean much from <i>The Magic Land</i> beyond its delightful writing, but for those with virtually no gardening experience, this is the perfect book. The author's voice is intimate, her guidance is knowledgeable, and she does a good job of beginning at the beginning. --Karen Karleski</p></p><h2>Life Issues, Medical Choices: Questions and Answers for Catholics</h2><p>Medical and technological advances over the last decades have left millions of Catholics grappling with tough issues.

Countess Katherine "Kat" de Montrain (who occasionally runs with Robin's band as Lady Greensleeves) is a spoiled woman who, Drake implies, needs a good spanking (from the right man) to set her straight. She meets her match in Damian Montjoy, Count Clifford, sent home from the Crusades by King Richard to marry her and oppose Prince John's bid for power. Damian, disguised as the Silver Sword, arrives just in time to steal Kat away from the prince, who is scheming to marry her off to an evil crony. Not recognizing her captor and hoping to avoid marrying Damian, whom she had once unpleasantly encountered, Kat offers to sleep with the Silver Sword if he'll let her run away. He accepts but later denies the deal and leaves her to explain to an outraged Damian why she's not a virgin. But it is only a matter of time until their respective secret identities are revealed and Kat realizes she's been duped. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wolf Hunting</h2><p><p>In <i>Through Wolf's Eyes,</i> Jane Lindskold introduced Firekeeper, the young girl raised by intelligent, language-using wolves.

At this historical moment, when movement across boundaries is of critical importance for all areas of human life&#x2015;from media and entertainment to economy and politics&#x2015;Thomas Tweed offers a powerful vision of religion in motion, dynamic, alive with crossings and flows.</p><p>A deeply researched, broadly gauged, and vividly written study of religion such as few American scholars have ever attempted, <i>Crossing and Dwelling</i> depicts religion in place and in movement, dwelling and crossing. Tweed considers how religion situates devotees in time and space, positioning them in the body, the home, the homeland, and the cosmos. He explores how the religious employ tropes, artifacts, rituals, and institutions to mark boundaries and to prescribe and proscribe different kinds of movements across those boundaries; and how religions enable and constrain terrestrial, corporeal, and cosmic crossings. </p><p>Drawing on insights from the natural and social sciences, Tweed's work is grounded in the gritty particulars of distinctive religious practices, even as it moves toward ideas about cross-cultural patterns. At a time when scholars in many fields shy away from generalizations, this book offers a responsible way to think broadly about religion, a topic that is crucial for understanding the contemporary world. Lucid in explanations, engaging in presentation, rich in examples, <i>Crossing and Dwelling</i> has profound implications for the study and teaching of religion in our day.</p></p><p>Thomas A. Tweed is W. Harold and Martha Welch Endowed Chair in American Studies at the University of Notre Dame.&#x201c;<b>Thomas Tweed</b>'s new book is impressive in its synthetic originality, its comprehensiveness and its communicative style. It brings together many strands of contemporary theory that otherwise would not end up in the same book. It is compelling for its inventive exploration of a particular model of religion... <i>Crossing and Dwelling</i> constructs a remarkably thoughtful synthesis that will stimulate much discussion. It thoroughly de-essentialises religion while valiantly reinstating the pragmatic and extendable value of the category. The endnotes themselves are extraordinarily rich and extensive, with wide referencing to relevant literature outside religious studies, and the text is enhanced with twenty-four illustrations. For its combined scholarship, ingenuity and wide interest, the book will deservedly find its way onto many reading lists.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William E. Paden</b><b>, </b><b><i>Religion</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An engaging, original, and insightful approach to theorizing the transnational face of twenty-first-century religion.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven Engler</b><b>, </b><b><i>Religious Studies Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Tweed</b>'s contrast of religion in stasis and in motion helps illuminate the vexing issue of religious pluralism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Roger S.

While Tweed's theory is philosophically detailed, readers will be impressed with the wide array of religions and nationalities represented in the analysis... Any scholar interested in either religion or geography will find this volume a refreshing and enlightening study. Those interested in both religion and geography will soon find themselves woefully behind in their scholarship if they have not yet digested it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Ferber</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Religious Experience website</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Thomas Tweed</b>'s provocative, thoughtful, and meaningful insights into what it means to be religious are outlined in his new book... Tweed's work is most welcome to those of us who understand that being human has much to do with our imagining and making places... Cultural and social geographers will find Tweed's ideas useful in their work and in the classroom whether or not the actual subject material is related to the religious realm.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Annals of the Association of American Geographers</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Beginning with his reflections on the Cuban Catholic community in Miami, <b>Tweed</b> develops a dynamic and relational theory of religion he feels has been lacking. He sees the key ideas of religion as being place (dwelling) and travel and exile (crossing) and uses the concept of itinerary to examine both Eastern and Western religions. As Tweed sees it, religion acts like a compass, helping to situate people in the body, the home, the homeland, and the cosmos. At the same time, we are all crossing boundaries: terrestrial, corporal, and cosmic. He offers a thoughtful analysis of the nature of religion and speaks of the limitations of his theory as well as of its potential. This well-thought-out work, accessible to scholars and lay readers alike, is a worthy successor to Mircea Eliade's <i>Images and Symbols: Studies in Religious Symbolism</i>, which remains the classic text on the subject.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Augustine J. Curley</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a masterpiece. It belongs on everyone's shelf next to William James's <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>. <b>Tweed</b>'s book is at once elegant and informed, a thorough intellectual sighting of religion.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bruce B. Lawrence, Duke University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Tweed</b> boldly offers here a new and differently devised definition of religion. And he anchors that definition in widely disparate phenomena of religious life around the globe. It is refreshing to see an analysis that moves wisely beyond the insularity of past debates. This book will stir some still waters and elicit a profitable exchange of ideas.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel Pals, University of Miami</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Crossing and Dwelling</i> provides a strikingly new and compelling theory of religion. Religions, <b>Tweed</b> argues, are much like watches and compasses: they help people find their bearings. Throughout he offers numerous examples from a variety of traditions and contexts to illustrate the way that his theory works.

She begins with the lost colony of Roanoke and the early southern "tobacco brides" who came looking for a husband and sometimes -- thanks to the stupendously high mortality rate -- wound up marrying their way through three or four. Spanning wars, the pioneering days, the fight for suffrage, the Depression, the era of Rosie the Riveter, the civil rights movement, and the feminist rebellion of the 1970s, <em>America's Women</em> describes the way women's lives were altered by dress fashions, medical advances, rules of hygiene, social theories about sex and courtship, and the ever-changing attitudes toward education, work, and politics. While keeping her eye on the big picture, Collins still notes that corsets and uncomfortable shoes mattered a lot, too.</p><p>"The history of American women is about the fight for freedom," Collins writes in her introduction, "but it's less a war against oppressive men than a struggle to straighten out the perpetually mixed message about women's roles that was accepted by almost everybody of both genders."</p><p>Told chronologically through the compelling stories of individual lives that, linked together, provide a complete picture of the American woman's experience, <em>America's Women</em> is both a great read and a landmark work of history.</p></p><p>Well researched and well written, <i>America's Women: 400 Years of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates, and Heroines</i> is a powerful and important book. Starting with Pocahontas and Eleanor Dare (the first female colonist), this lively and fascinating history records the changes in American women's lives and the transformations in American society from the 1580s through the 2000s.<p> A history of the oft-marginalized sex must often draw from diaries and journals, which were disproportionally written by whites; as a result, African-American and Native American women are not as well represented as white in the earlier chapters of <i>America's Women</i>. However, Gail Collins writes about women of many races and ethnicities, and in fact provides more information about Native Americans, African-Americans, and Chinese, Jewish, and Italian immigrants than some general U.S. history books. She writes about rich and poor, young and old, urban and rural, slave and slave-owner, athlete and aviatrix, president's wife and presidential candidate--and, of course, men and women. And some of these women--from the justly famous, like Clara Barton and Harriet Tubman, to the undeservedly obscure, like Elizabeth Eckford and Senator Margaret Chase Smith--will not only make any woman proud to be a woman, they will make any American proud to be American.</p><p> An editor at the <i>New York Times</i>, Gail Collins has also written <i>Scorpion Tongues: Gossip, Celebrity, and American Politics</i> and, with Dan Collins, <i>The Millennium Book</i>. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p>Gail Collins, a columnist for the <em>New York Times</em>, was the the first woman ever to serve as editorial page editor for the paper.

It proves to be an apt name, at least as far as Chester the cat is concerned. Well-read and observant, Chester soon decides that there is something odd about the newcomer. For one thing, he seems to have fangs. And the odd markings on his back took a bit like a cape. Furthermore, Bunnicula sleeps from sunup to sundown and is awake only at night. </p><p> Is Bunnicula really a vampire? Only Bunnicula knows for sure.

It all starts when Harold's human family, the Monroes, goes to see the movie <i>Dracula</i>, and young Toby accidentally sits on a baby rabbit wrapped in a bundle on his seat. How could the family help but take the rabbit home and name it Bunnicula? Chester, the literate, sensitive, and keenly observant family cat, soon decides there is something weird about this rabbit. Pointy fangs, the appearance of a cape, black-and-white coloring, nocturnal habits ... it sure seemed like he was a vampire bunny. When the family finds a white tomato in the kitchen, sucked dry and colorless, well ... Chester becomes distraught and fears for the safety of the family. "Today, vegetables. Tomorrow ... the world!" he warns Harold. But when Chester tries to make his fears known to the Monroes, he is completely misunderstood, and the results are truly hilarious. Is Bunnicula really a vampire bunny? We can't say. But any child who has ever let his or her imagination run a little wild will love Deborah and James Howe's funny, fast-paced "rabbit-tale of mystery." <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>This book is written by Harold. His fulltime occupation is dog. He lives with Mr. and Mrs. Monroe and their sons Toby and Pete. Also sharing the home are a cat named Chester and a rabbit named Bunnicula. It is because of Bunnicula that Harold turned to writing. Someone had to tell the full story of what happened in the Monroe household after the rabbit arrived. <p>Was Bunnicula really a vampire? Only Bunnicula knows for sure.

One God Clapping is the story of his roundabout yet continuously provoking spiritual odyssey. It is also the story of the meeting between East and West in America and the ways in which that encounter has transformed how we understand our God and ourselves.<br>Born in Brooklyn, where his grandfathers introduce him to the rituals of Jewish life, Lew is uprooted when his family moves to the suburbs. From there, his quest for spiritual solace begins, seeing him through the flowering of the sixties in California where, in the company of poets, hipsters, and beats, he settles on Zen Buddhism as a spiritual path. The enhanced self-awareness he chronicles leads to a completely unexpected revelation - the depth of his attachment to being a Jew. His interest in Buddhism begins to wane, culminating in his decision to become a rabbi. Yet even upon settling in as rabbi of the largest conservative synagogue in San Francisco, he is not at the end of his search for a spiritual home. Forced to answer questions about his Buddhist past, he is obliged to examine more closely the nature of spiritual practice and determine exactly what Buddhism and Judaism have to offer each other.<br>Like a Zen parable or a Jewish folk tale, One God Clapping unfolds as a series of stories, each containing a moment of revelation or instruction that, while often unexpected, is never simple of contrived. Like the life of Alan Lew himself, this book is a bold experiment in the integration of Eastern and Western ways of looking at and living in the world.</p><p>Like a Zen parable or a Jewish folk tale, One God Clapping unfolds as a series of stories, each containing a moment of revelation or instruction that, while often unexpected, is never simple or contrived.

The worst fears of the Founders are being realized, as powerful corporate interests have taken over our culture and representative government. We the People now face a fundamental choice: take back our country ... or do nothing, and become victims of tyranny and empire.</p><p>Thom Hartmann, our contemporary Thomas Paine, has done the hard work of researching and reading the documents that show how ordinary Americans have become second-class citizens -- overshadowed by the first-class "personhood" of corporations, their directors and officers, and the politicians they put in office.

Bush&#39;s Skull and Bones experiences. Formerly on the staff of the New Yorker, she is the co-author of the New York Times bestseller QUARTERLIFE CRISIS. She lives in the Washington, DC area.Robbins (Quarterlife Crisis) begins by setting readers up with the ridiculous myth of Yale's Skull and Bones, an exclusive society whose powerful members including both presidents Bush are sworn to secrecy for life about the club's activities: the myth says that the society's members form a clique that rules the world. Robbins then proposes demystifying the group. On the one hand, she propagates the myth, spelling out how Bonesmen have promoted one another in enormously successful political and business careers; they presided over the creation of the atomic bomb as well as the CIA, she says. On the other hand, Robbins turns up much that is prosaic, as she traces the society's origins back to 1832, when William Russell founded it as retribution for a classmate's having been passed over by Phi Beta Kappa; she discovers that the club's cryptic iconography is derived from German university societies. She reveals the inventory of the Tomb (an evocative name for what is essentially a frat house) and details about the group's oddly juvenile fraternal ritual. The narrative never gets more dramatic than Robbins staking out the Tomb for President George W. Bush during Yale's tercentennial celebrations in 2002, and while she relies heavily on the testimony of many Bonesmen, she never names names. While the book may demystify Skull and Bones, it also imparts the sense that Robbins, herself a Yale graduate and member of a rival society, believes in Yalies' elitist entitlement to power and prestige.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Everything I Know About Lean I Learned in First Grade</h2><p>Building on the precedence created by other great Lean books, Everything I Know About Lean I Learned in First Grade brings Lean back to its original simplicity by showing how Lean is alive in a first grade classroom.

Unseen</h2><p><blockquote>It's the deadliest ship in the world. <br> You cannot see it. <br> You cannot hear it. <br> And it's just fallen into enemy hands. </blockquote><p> Patrick Robinson became an instant hit with his widely acclaimed New York Times bestseller <em>Nimitz Class </em> and then did it again with his second gripping novel <em>Kilo Class.</em> Now this nationally bestselling author returns with his most suspenseful naval technothriller yet--a tense, unpredictable adventure that rivals the best of Tom Clancy and Dale Brown. </p><p> The most highly efficient and lethal underwater ship ever built--even better than the Russian Kilo Class, and nearly impossible to detect--the 2,500-ton H.M.S. <em>Unseen</em> is one of only four diesel-electric submarines ever owned by the Royal Navy. While out on a training mission off the coast of England, the unthinkable happens: The ship vanishes into the depths, baffling British and American military intelligence, including wily National Security Adviser Admiral Arnold Morgan. </p><p> </p><blockquote>"Submarines are very, very dangerous and very, very sneaky. You just don't want 'em wandering around on the loose when no one knows where they are. You have to keep an eye on them. If there's one thing that makes me real nervous, it's a submarine that's somehow gone off the charts." </blockquote> <p>One year later, Morgan's foreboding is about to be proven deadly. </p><p>On a routine flight, the Concorde, the world's safest and most secure domestic plane, disappears without a trace over the frigid waters of the North Atlantic. A few months later the brand new Starstriker jet, a miracle in American aeronautic technology and supersonic travel, vanishes. Both appear to be random, inexplicable accidents, until another plane--<em>Air Force Three,</em> carrying the vice president of the United States--is blown from the sky. </p><p>Searching for answers, the brilliant, irascible Morgan devises a chilling theory. Not only is <em>Unseen</em> still out there, but it's been modified to become the most dangerous anti-aircraft weapon at sea. And the admiral is convinced that only one man could have masterminded it: The world's most cunning--and reportedly dead--terrorist spy, Iraqi's Commander Benjamin Adnam, the incomparable operative who hired a nuclear sub and destroyed the carrier U.S.S. <em>Thomas Jefferson</em> a few years before.</p><p>Determined to stop his old nemesis before he strikes again, Morgan must use all his wits to find Adnam and the rogue sub hiding somewhere in a million square miles of dark ocean water, a mission the admiral knows is about as easy finding a needle in a desert--blind. But what Morgan doesn't know is that the fanatically religious military terrorist has a chilling agenda of his own--a plan that will bring these two intense warriors face to face.and only one will come out alive. </p><p>A breathtaking tale that races from the shifting sands of the Middle East to deep within the black waters of the North Atlantic; from the Oval Office to the bowels of one of the most powerful warships ever built; <em>H.M.S. Unseen</em> will keep readers guessing as they race to discover its powerful, stunning conclusion.</p></p><p>Patrick Robinson might not be the smoothest writer in the world, but for action on and around the sea he's as good as Tom Clancy or the late, much-missed Hammond Innes. Robinson's latest finds ace Iraqi terrorist Benjamin Adnam--supposedly killed at the end of <i>Nimitz Class</i>--alive and decorated in Baghdad. Ben instinctively knows that he is no longer useful to Saddam Hussein, and sure enough, he surprises and kills an official hit squad waiting for him at his home. Burning with the desire for revenge, Ben walks to Iran (a two-week trek through desert and marshes wonderfully described by Robinson) and convinces that country's leaders to help him launch a scheme that will punish both Iraq and the Great Satan, America.<p> Commander Adnam, trained as a submariner in England and Israel, hijacks the HMS <i>Unseen,</i>, one of the world's most dangerous and undetectable subs, refits it with Russian missile launchers, and uses it to shoot down three very high-profile airplanes, including a supersonic Concorde and a plane carrying America's much beloved vice president (this is 2006, by the way). As planned, the Iraqis are widely suspected--but national security adviser Albert Morgan recognizes Adnam's handiwork and begins a global search. There's a beautifully detailed journey, across Scotland and Ireland, before the book settles down into a smaller but satisfying story of Adnam's personal quest for some kind of redemption. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>The H.M.S. Unseen is one of the most efficient, lethal submarines ever built. But suddenly, on a training mission off the English coast, it vanishes, baffling military intelligence on both sides of the Atlantic, including National Security Adviser Admiral Arnold Morgan. A missing weapon is dangerous enough. But then the unthinkable begins to happen....Planes begin blowing up across the skies.<p>Searching for answers, Morgan is convinced that only one man can be behind all these devastating events: his archenemy, the world's most cunning -- yet reportedly dead -- terrorist spy. Determined to stop his old nemesis, Morgan must use all his wits to find a madman armed with a powerful sub hidden somewhere in a million square miles of ocean. What Morgan doesn't know, however, is that the fanatical terrorist has a plan of his own, one that will bring these two intense warriors face-to-face -- and only one will come out alive in one of the most chilling spy stories of the year.</p></p><h2>Swords In The Mist</h2><p>1st edition 1st printing paperback, vg+ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>Neil Gaiman is the author of many bestsellers for readers of all ages including <i>Stardust</i> (the basis for the blockbuster movie), <i>Fragile Things</i>, <i>Anansi Boys</i>, <i>Interworld</i>, and <i>Coraline</i>.

He wrote more than ninety books, and his works, translated into many languages, won him worldwide acclaim.Having joyfully awarded the coveted Earphones Award to two of Wodehouse&#39;s comedies (Jeeves Takes Charge and Heavy Weather), I must say that Davidson is not a masterful Wodehouse narrator like Edward Duke or Jeremy Sinden. Davidson has a urbane, British intonation, but his voice is just a shade too sardonic and bored to carry off Wodehouse. His light characterizations of the British male uppercrust come off well, but he&#39;s not successful with the women, who seem lifeless. However, the story is hilarious, and those who have not heard Wodehouse by the other narrators will enjoy it. D.W.

Its deeply rooted history makes it a perennial destination, with more than 3.5 million visitors each year. Although it is one of the most high profile towns in the country, Newport is also one of the most cloistered. Private Newport: At Home and in the Garden offers an invitation to venture beyond the privet hedges and massive iron gates. It is the first book to step inside the privately owned mansions to reveal a diverse collection of architectural jewels complemented by spectacular gardens. These homes, created by distinguished architects and landscape designers, are stunning examples of Newport&#39;s 375-year &#34;old-world&#34; heritage. Eighteen exquisite and unique homes are prominently featured-from the resilient crescent curve of majestic Seafair, which withstood the Hurricane of &#39;38, to the prizewinning Japanese garden at Wildacre, to the nostalgic working farm of heritage breeds at Swiss Village-each contributing its own part to the &#34;Eden of America.&#34;</p><p>Bettie Bearden Pardee is a seasoned lecturer and an active member of the Newport community. She was contributing editor to Bon Appetit for ten years and author of the "Entertaining with Style" column. She produced and hosted the fifteen-part PBS series "The Presidential Palate: Entertaining at the White House" and has produced segments, and appeared on, many TV spots including Good Morning America and Live with Regis and Kathy Lee. She and her husband divide their time between Newport, Atlanta, and New York.<br><br>Photographer Mick Hales's work has appeared in House and Garden, Vanity Fair, Architectural Record, and Town and Country. His books include Monastic Gardens (Stewart, Tabori, and Chang, 2000).<br>The co-chair of the annual Newport Flower Show and a flower-arranging judge with the Garden Club of America, Pardee was a Bon Appetit contributing editor for 10 years and hosted the PBS series The Presidential Palate: Entertaining at the White House. Unlike many residents, Pardee lives in Newport year-round and, though the scale of this land of scions and heiress has been reduced, there&#x2019;s still plenty of wealth hidden there. As Marion Oates Charles writes in the introduction, "Private Newport revolves, for the most part, around a community at ease with itself." The residents are not pictured here, but they do speak to Pardee about the 18 properties on which she has chosen to focus. There is "A Rocky Hall Christmas" with a giant decorated fir glowing before a burnished wood living room; there are "Sunset Views at Pelican Ledge," where the fireplace is inset with Wedgwood porcelain. While many of the houses date back generations, and period furnishings are appropriate to them, many of the book&#x2019;s color photos make an eerie, Stepford-like impression. It&#x2019;s as if the American upper class&#x2019;s idea of style were frozen in time, endlessly copying 18th-century English and French manors. Pardee is knowledgeable about the histories of various houses ("Gray Craig had a large staff, including thirty gardeners in the summer"), and her pleasure in them is clearly evident. The photos are well-framed and lit, though the interiors can seem chill and antiseptic. But the book&#x2019;s other main attractions, the sea and the gardens that surround it, are undeniably sumptuous.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Employing a wealth of primary sources from various active organs of the Islamic Republic, the authors demonstrate how popular belief and ritual were converted into stamps, banknotes, posters, even chewing gum wrappers, and directed towards mass mobilization for revolution and war.

The chugging hiss of the motionless locomotive could barely be heard above the bewildered lowing of the steers and the clatter of cloven hooves on the wooden ramp of the loading chutes. The noise was punctuated by shouts and curses from cowboys as they poked the steers with long prods to force them up the chute and into the rail cars. </p><p> "Eighteen!" </p><p> With one cattle car filled to capacity, the locomotive rumbled out of its idle snoring to pull its string of cars ahead so the next one could be loaded. Plumes of smoke rose from its stack as the lumbering train's clanks and rattles added to the existing cacophony. Loading cattle destined for the slaughterhouses in the East was a tedious chore, made more unpleasant by the noise and the collective stench of penned animals. </p><p> Benteen Calder watched the proceedings from the sidelines. The wide hat brim shaded his sun-creased features and partially concealed his restless, assessing gaze. His dark hair was shot with silver and the middle fifties had put some weight on his big-boned frame, but there was no mistaking that he was of the kind that produced the cattle kings. Piece by piece, he had carved out the Triple C Ranch with his sweat, his blood, and his cunning. He'd fought outlaws, renegade Indians, and greedy neighbors to keep the ranch. There would always be someone wanting it. And the man christened Chase Benteen Calder knew that. </p><p> The cattle being driven up the loading chute carried the Triple C brand, marking them as the property of the Calder Cattle Company -- his ranch. The dry summer had left the steers in less than top condition for market, but the weather in eastern Montana was seldom ideal. </p><p> After nearly six weeks of roundup, Benteen was conscious of the soreness in his aging muscles. Absently, he rubbed at the stiffness in his left arm. He picked up a movement to the right and shifted his head slightly to identify the figure approaching him. The corners of his mouth lifted in a silent greeting as Benteen recognized the railroad man, Bobby John Thomas. </p><p> "Oughta be through loadin' here in another hour," the man observed without any preliminary greeting. </p><p> "More or less," Benteen agreed with a faint nod. </p><p> The local railroad man's sharp eyes spotted a steer with an odd brand among the penned cattle. "I see you picked up some estrays. Diamond T." He read the brand and frowned. "Don't recall seeing that brand around here." </p><p> "I think it's a Dakota brand." It was impossible to know the various brands of ranches located outside of the state, and Benteen didn't try. "All told, we've got fourteen estrays in this shipment." </p><p> A description of each was listed on the shipping manifest. Given the wandering tendencies of cattle and their lack of respect for boundary lines or fences, it was inevitable that a beef roundup would include cattle owned by other outfits. Reps from neighboring ranches were always on hand for just that reason. If there was no representative for a given brand with the crew, the animal was always included in the market shipment. Left to roam, the estrayed cattle would eventually die of old age, benefiting no one. More important, it would eat grass that could have supported the range owner's cattle. </p><p> When the estrayed steer arrived at the terminal market, a brand inspector would spot it and payment for its sale would be forwarded to the animal's rightful owner. Such a practice, by both the rancher finding the estray and the brand inspector, was regarded as a courtesy of the range, observed by all and rarely abused. It was the Golden Rule put into practice -- "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." </p><p> Another railroad car had its load of steers and the door was slid shut. The train's engine began a racing chug to bring the next car into position. During the short respite in the loading operation, one of the cowboys stepped down from his perch on the chute and removed his hat, wiping his forearm across his brow, then jammed his hat back onto his nearly black hair all in one motion. A brief glimpse at his angular features, the color and texture of richly grained leather, was enough to hint at a similarity between the young cowboy and the owner of the penned cattle. </p><p> Bobby John Thomas looked at Benteen. "Is that yore boy Webb?" </p><p> There was an imperceptible tightening of Benteen's mouth as he nodded an affirmative answer. A troubled light flickered in his eyes, put there by a gnawing worry that wouldn't go away. </p><p> "He sure has growed since the last time I saw him," the railroad agent remarked. </p><p> "Yeah." The abruptness of the response seemed to carry a negative connotation. Benteen didn't volunteer the information that, so far, Webb had only grown in size. The promise his son had shown in his early years hadn't yet developed in adulthood. </p><p> There was much about the tall, huskily built youth for Benteen to be proud of. At twenty-six, Webb was one of the top hands on the Triple C Ranch. He could ride the rankest bronc, rope with the best of them, and turn his hand to almost anything. Webb never shirked from hard work, so Benteen couldn't fault him for that. It was responsibility that Webb avoided, accepting it only when it was forced on him. On those rare occasions, he handled it well, making few wrong decisions. But it was that lack of interest in assuming an active role in the management of the ranch that troubled Benteen. The more he pushed Webb about it, reminding him that the Triple C would be his someday, the less interest Webb displayed. </p><p> Lorna didn't help the situation by insisting that Benteen was expecting too much from their son. It was her opinion that Webb was still too young and needed time to sow his wild oats before taking on any responsibility in running the ranch. Maybe she was right, but he'd been the same age as Webb when he'd driven the herd of Longhorns north from Texas to found the Triple C Ranch. It worried him to think he'd raised a son who was content to take orders instead of giving them. The future of the ranch depended on his son. </p><p> Moving his attention from the leanly muscled frame of his big-boned son, the source of his vague anxiety, Benteen half-turned toward the agent. His face showed none of his inner disturbance. </p><p> "Ya been keeping busy, Bobby John?" he inquired. </p><p> "We've been busy, but we haven't been makin' much money," the agent declared on a rueful note. </p><p> Benteen's mouth quirked in a dry line. "That's always the railroad's complaint. And it gets harder to swallow every time I see the freight rates go up." </p><p> "It's a fact." Bobby John was a loyal company man. "We may haul a lot of cattle out of Miles City in the fall, but we don't haul enough in or out on a regular basis. We just ain't got the people here, or the goods." </p><p> "I suppose," Benteen conceded. </p><p> "That might all change, though." The comment was made, then left to lie there like a baited hook allowed to settle near a submerged log where a big fish rested. </p><p> Benteen's interest in the conversation was no longer idle, his curiosity aroused by the remark. "Why is that?" </p><p> "Some fella plowed him some ground up around the Musselshell River and planted him some wheat. Rumor has it that he harvested forty bushels to an acre." He saw the skepticism in Benteen's dark eyes. "He used that dryland method of farming like they developed in Kansas." </p><p> Benteen had a sketchy understanding of the principle involved in such a method. In arid land where there wasn't a local water source to provide irrigation, crops were planted on only half the acreage while the other half was left fallow. This idle land was plowed and harrowed so no plant life would consume any moisture that fell on it. The next year, that half would be planted to crops. It was a way of conserving the moisture from rain and snow for the next year's use. </p><p> "It won't work here," Benteen stated flatly, regardless of the evidence just given to the contrary. "This is cow country. That's all it is good for. Besides, I've never heard of a farmer yet who could make a living on just eighty acres." That was half of the one hundred and sixty acres entitled for homestead, and the only part that was productive at any one time under the dryland method of farming. </p><p> "That may be true," Bobby John admitted. "But I've heard talk that there's a proposal bein' presented to the Congress to double the amount of acreage allowed under the Homestead Act." </p><p> Benteen's chin lifted a fraction of an inch in reaction to this new information. An uneasy feeling ran through him as he looked beyond the cattle pens of the railroad yard to the grassland. </p><p> In the autumn afternoon the stark Montana landscape looked like a sea of tanned stalks. It was the best damned grass any cowman could hope to find. The idea of its being ripped up by a plow and replaced by wheat was more than he could stand. A lot of things were different from the way they had been when he had first arrived in the territory, but this was one change Benteen wouldn't accept. He'd fight any attempt to turn this cow country into farmland. </p><p> "They'll never be able to push that bill through Congress." There was a steely quality to his voice, but the prospect of a battle, political or otherwise, added its weight to the tiredness in his bones. </p><p> "I wouldn't be too sure about that," Bobby John Thomas warned him. "It ain't just a bunch of land-hungry farmers that wants to see it pass." But he added no more than that. </p><p> Benteen silently cursed himself for speaking without thinking through the opposition. Farmers were the least of his worries. It was the railroads. They were land-poor in this part of the West, owners of thousands of square-mile tracts of land along their right-of-way, deeded to them by the U.S. government for laying track. The railroads would use an enlarged Homestead Act like a carrot to lure the farmers out here and end up selling them land for farms or townsites. They'd create a land boom that would bring settlers in, tradesmen as well as farmers. People needed products, which meant more freight generated for the railroads. </p><p> It didn't take much intelligence to figure it out. The railroads had done the same thing in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado, where that prairie sod was now sown with some Russian strain of wheat. But this land wasn't the same. Methods that worked there couldn't work here. </p><p> The proposal coming before Congress had to be stopped, and stopped swiftly. Benteen knew in his gut that he couldn't waste any time, yet the six-week-long roundup had left him in a state of fatigue. Even if he looked the physical equal of his son, he no longer had the resilience of his youth. </p><p> "Guess I'd better be gettin' back to my office." Bobby John Thomas shifted his position in a show of reluctance to put his words into action, but Benteen said nothing to invite the railroad agent to stay longer and chat. "Give my regards to your missus." </p><p> "I will." An image formed in his mind of Lorna waiting for him at the hotel in town. He suddenly felt an overwhelming need to be with her. Benteen barely noticed the agent move away, his attention already traveling down another channel. His glance swept the cattle pens and loading platform in an effort to locate Barnie Moore, then came to a stop on his son. Dammit, it was going to be his ranch and his land someday, Benteen thought with a frown of irritable concern. "Webb!" There was an edge to his voice as he raised its volume to make himself heard. </p><p> With a turn of his head, Webb looked over his shoulder and saw the single motion from his father that indicated he wanted to speak to him. He swung down from the loading chute onto the platform and handed the long prod to another cowboy to take his place. As Webb approached his father, he experienced that strange feeling of pride and resentment -- pride for the man that Chase Benteen Calder was and the wide swath he'd cut across this land practically singlehandedly, and resentment for the same reasons. </p><p> He didn't want to be his father's son; he didn't want to be singled out from the other hands because his name was Calder; he wanted to earn his right to command, even though he was born in the position to inherit it. He would rather have been born Webb Smith than Webb Calder, so his was a quiet rebellion -- never overt, always subtle -- denying himself the right to claim what was his by birth. Webb made it a practice not to assert himself or his opinions with the other ranch hands. In spite of that, all the cowboys, except the older ones who had come north with his father, turned to Webb whenever there was a decision to be made, deferring to him because he was a Calder. That angered him, although he seldom let it show. </p><p> Webb knew his father was disappointed in him. He'd been lectured enough times about accepting responsibility. Only once had Webb tried to explain the way he felt, his determination to be accepted because of his ability, rather than rest on the circumstances of his birth. His father had brushed it aside as a foolish whim, needlessly reminding Webb that he couldn't change the fact that he was born a Calder. Rebuffed by this lack of understanding, Webb had taken the lonely path, not able to be just one of the boys and refusing to assume the role his father wanted for him. More than once, he had considered tying his bedroll on the back of his saddle and riding away from the Triple C; then he'd think about his mother and he'd stay, hoping something would change. </p><p> "Yes, sir?" Webb stopped in front of his father, letting the inflection of his voice question why he had been summoned. He hadn't addressed him as Pa in more than six years. </p><p> There was nothing in his son's attitude or expression that showed more than casual interest. Benteen probed, hoping to find more. He never knew what the boy was thinking -- or if he was thinking. A father should know what was going on in his son's head. Benteen knew he didn't. </p><p> "I want you to go to the telegraph office and send some wires for me," Benteen stated. "One of them goes to Frank Bulfert, the senator's aide, in Washington. In the wire, I want you to ask him the status of the proposal being brought to Congress to enlarge the Homestead Act and what kind of preliminary support it's getting. Ask for the same information from Asa Morgan in Helena. The last wire I want you to send to Bull Giles at the Black Dove Bar in Washington with the same request for information." The lack of interest Webb showed made him feel weary. "Have you got all that?" </p><p> "Yes, sir." Behind the smooth exterior, his mind was running over the possible significance of the information being sought and how it might affect the ranch. "Is there anything else?" </p><p> "No." His lips thinned into a tired line. "Don't you want to know why this information is important?" Benteen asked, and had the satisfaction of seeing his son's steady gaze waver briefly. </p><p> "I figured you'd tell me when you thought it was right for me to know." There was no hesitation over the reply, and the invitation to ask...</p></p><h2>Rise of the Mystics (Beyond the Circle)</h2><p>Some say the great mystery of how one can live in two worlds at once died with Thomas Hunter many years ago.

Latigo Canyon was mile after mile of neck-wrenching, hairpin twists. Charley had no use for government meddlers but the 15 mph signs posted along the road were smart.<br><br> He lived ten miles up from Kanan Dume Road, on a four-acre remnant of the ranch his grandfather had owned during Coolidge&#x2019;s time. All those Arabians and Tennessee walkers and the mules Grandpa kept around because he liked the creatures&#x2019; spirit. Charley had grown up with families like his. No-nonsense ranchers, a few rich folk who were still okay when they came up to ride on weekends. Now all you had were rich pretenders.<br><br> Diabetic and rheumatoid and depressed, Charley lived in a two-room cabin with a view of oak-covered crests and the ocean beyond. Sixty-eight, never married. Poor excuse for a man, he&#x2019;d scold himself on nights when the medicines mixed with the beer and his mood sank low.<br><br> On happier days, he pretended to be an old cowboy.<br><br> This morning, he was somewhere between those extremes. His bunions hurt like hell. Two horses had died last winter and he was down to three skinny white mares and a half-blind sheepdog. Feed and hay bills ate up most of his Social Security. But the nights had been warm for October, and he hadn&#x2019;t dreamed bad and his bones felt okay.<br><br> It was hay that got him up at seven that morning, rolling out of bed, gulping coffee, chewing on a stale sweet roll, to hell with his blood sugar. A little time-out to get the internal plumbing going and by eight he was dressed and starting up the pickup.<br><br> Coasting in neutral down the dirt road that fed to Latigo, he looked both ways a couple of times, cleared the crust from his eyes, shifted into first, and rolled down. The Topanga Feed Bin was a twenty-minute ride south and he figured to stop along the way at the Malibu Stop &amp; Shop for a few six-packs, a tin of Skoal, and some Pringles.<br><br> Nice morning, a big old blue sky with just a few clouds from the east, sweet air blowing up from the Pacific. Switching on his eight-track, he listened to Ray Price and drove slow enough to stop for deer. Not too many of the pests before dark but you never knew what to expect up in the mountains.<br><br> The naked girl jumped out at him a lot faster than any deer.<br><br> Eyes full of terror, mouth stretched so wide Charley swore he could see her tonsils.<br><br> She ran across the road, straight in the path of his truck, hair blowing wild, waving her arms.<br><br> Stomping the brake pedal hard, Charley felt the pickup lurch, wobble, and sway. Then the sharp skid to the left, straight at the battered guardrail that separated him from a thousand foot of nothing.<br><br> Hurtling toward blue sky.<br><br> He kept hitting the brake. Kept flying. Said his prayers and opened the door and prepared to bail.<br><br> His damn shirt stuck on the door handle. Eternity looked real close. What a stupid way to go!<br><br> Hands ripping at his shirt fabric, mouth working in a combination of curses and benedictions, Charley&#x2019;s gnarled body tightened, his legs turned to iron bars, and his sore foot pressed that brake pedal down to the damn floorboard.<br><br> The truck kept going, fishtailed, slid, spattered gravel.<br><br> Shuddered. Rolled. Bumped the guard.<br><br> Charley could hear the rail groan.<br><br> The truck stopped.<br><br> Charley freed his shirt and got out. His chest was tight and he couldn&#x2019;t suck any breath into his lungs. Wouldn&#x2019;t that be the shits: spared a free fall to oblivion only to drop dead of a damned heart attack.<br><br> He gasped and swallowed air, felt his field of vision grow black and braced himself against the truck. The chassis creaked and Charley jumped back, felt himself going down again.<br><br> A scream pierced the morning. Charley opened his eyes and straightened and saw the girl. Red marks around her wrists and ankles. Bruises around her neck.<br><br> Beautiful young body, those healthy knockers bobbing as she came running toward him&#x2014;sinful to think like that, she was scared, but with knockers like that what else was there to notice?<br><br> She kept coming, arms wide, like she wanted Charley to hold her.<br><br> But screaming, those wild eyes, he wasn&#x2019;t sure what to do.<br><br> First time in a long time he&#x2019;d been this close to bare female flesh.<br><br> He forgot about the knockers, nothing sexy about this. She was a kid, young enough to be his daughter. Granddaughter.<br><br> Those marks on her wrists and ankles, around her neck.<br><br> She screamed again.<br><br> &#x201c;Ohgodohgoohgod.&#x201d;<br><br> She was right up to him, now, yellow hair whipping his face. He could smell the fear on her. See the goose bumps on her pretty tan shoulders.<br><br> &#x201c;Help me!&#x201d;<br><br> Poor kid was shivering.<br><br> Charley held her.<br><br> CHAPTER<br><br> 2<br><br> L.A.&#x2019;s where you end up when you have nowhere else to go. A long time ago I&#x2019;d driven west from Missouri, a sixteen-year-old high school graduate armed with a head full of desperation and a partial academic scholarship to the U.<br><br> Only son of a moody, hard drinker and a chronic depressive. Nothing to keep me in the flatlands.<br><br> Living like a pauper on work-study and occasional guitar gigs in wedding bands, I managed to get educated. Made some money as a psychologist, and a lot more from lucky investments. Got The House In The Hills.<br><br> Relationships were another story, but that would&#x2019;ve been true no matter where I lived.<br><br> Back when I treated children, I routinely took histories from parents and learned what family life could be like in L.A. People packing up and moving every year or two, the surrender to impulse, the death of domestic ritual.<br><br> Many of the patients I saw lived in sun-baked tracts with no other kids nearby and spent hours each day being bused to and from beige corrals that claimed to be schools. Long, electronic nights were bleached by cathode and thump-thumped by the current angry music. Bedroom windows looked out to hazy miles of neighborhoods that couldn&#x2019;t really be called that.<br><br> Lots of imaginary friends in L.A. That, I supposed, was inevitable. It&#x2019;s a company town and the product is fantasy.<br><br> The city kills grass with red carpets, worships fame for its own sake, demolishes landmarks with glee because the high-stakes game is reinvention. Show up at your favorite restaurant and you&#x2019;re likely to find a sign trumpeting failure and the windows covered with brown paper. Phone a friend and get a disconnected number.<br><br> No Forwarding. It could be the municipal motto.<br><br> You can be gone in L.A. for a long time before anyone considers it a problem.<br> When Michaela Brand and Dylan Meserve went missing, no one seemed to notice.<br><br> Michaela&#x2019;s mother was a former truck-stop cashier living with an oxygen tank in Phoenix. Her father was unknown, probably one of the teamsters Maureen Brand had entertained over the years. Michaela had left Arizona to get away from the smothering heat, gray shrubs, air that never moved, no one caring about The Dream.<br><br> She rarely called her mother. The hiss of Maureen&#x2019;s tank, Maureen&#x2019;s sagging body, ragged cough, and emphysemic eyes drove her nuts. No room for any of that in Michaela&#x2019;s L.A. head.<br><br> Dylan Meserve&#x2019;s mother was long dead from an undiagnosed degenerative neuromuscular disease. His father was a Brooklyn-based alto sax player who&#x2019;d never wanted a rug rat in the first place and had died of an overdose five years ago.<br><br> Michaela and Dylan were gorgeous and young and thin and had come to L.A. for the obvious reason.<br><br> By day, he sold shoes at a Foot Locker in Brentwood.

They&#x2019;d worked their butts off on a scene from Simpatico. Neither really got what Sam Shepard was aiming for but the play had plenty of juicy parts, all that screaming. Nora Dowd had urged them to inject themselves in the scene, smell the horseshit, open themselves up to the pain and the hopelessness.<br><br> Both of them felt they&#x2019;d delivered. Dylan&#x2019;s Vinnie had been perfectly wild and crazy and dangerous, and Michaela&#x2019;s Rosie was a classy woman of mystery.<br><br> Nora Dowd had seemed okay with the performance, especially Dylan&#x2019;s contribution.<br><br> That frosted Michaela a bit but she wasn&#x2019;t surprised.<br><br> Watching Nora go off on one of those speeches about right brain&#x2013; left brain.

The first campaigns of the British Expeditionary Force brought admiration from the enemy, but by the end of 1914 it had been virtually eliminated. Kitchener&#39;s call for new volunteers drew such a patriotic response that by mid-1916 the BEF had grown to 55 divisions. This book explains and llustrates the uniform, equipment and organization of the British Army up to the end of the battle of the Somme.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Mike Chappell comes from an Aldershot family with British Army connections stretching back several generations. He enlisted as a teenage private in the Royal Hampshire Regiment in 1952. Over the next 22 years of infantry soldiering, many of them spent with the Gloucester Regiment, he held every rank and many regimental appointments up to WO1 and Regimental Sergeant Major. he retired in 1974, as RSM of the 1st Battalion The Wessex Regiment (Rifle Volunteers), after seeing service in Malaya, Cyprus, Swaziland, Libya, Germany, Ulster and home garrisons. He began painting military subjects in 1968 and since then has gained worldwide popularity as a military illustrator. Mike has written and illustrated many quality books for Osprey.</p><h2>Choosing to Love the World: On Contemplation</h2><p><p>Amid the noise and distractions of everyday life, is it really possible to choose to love the world? In these times of great uncertainty and anxiety, how can we find God? Thomas Merton felt the urgency of these questions more than 50 years ago, and his reflections upon them are more relevant than ever. </p><p>One of America's most beloved mystics of the 20th century, Merton's voice was prophetic in the troubled era of the 1960s. In this new collection of thoughts and meditations selected from his most inspiring books and letters, Merton's radiant wisdom and foresight serve as a beacon of light for all of us searching to find true meaning and solace in today's difficult times.</p><p>"Father Louis," as he was known at the Abbey of Gethsemani, fully embraced the contemplative life of a monk, yet he never held the world at arm's length: "We and our world interpenetrate. It is only in assuming full responsibility for our world, for our lives and for ourselves, that we can be said to live really for God."</p><p>Sharply honest in his words but balanced by his poet's heart, Merton explores themes that include the inner ground of love, living in wisdom, and dialoguing with silence. He teaches that contemplation is possible for everyone and that the fundamental context for seeking God's presence is always our everyday lives. </p><p>"In the deep silence, wisdom begins to sing her unending, sunlit, inexpressible song: the private song she speaks to the solitary soul." In <em>Choosing to Love the World</em>, Thomas Merton inspires us to look deep within ourselves and, in the peaceful silence of contemplation, to find and sing our own song.</p><p>Edited by Jonathan Montaldo, associate director of The Merton Institute for Contemplative Living, and director of Bethany Spring, the Merton Institute retreat center in Trappist, Kentucky.</p></p><p><b>Thomas Merton</b><br><p>Thomas Merton (1915&#x2013;1968)</p><p>Thomas Merton is renowned as one of the most influential American spiritual writers and social activists of the 20th century. His autobiography <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> has sold more than one million copies, and he wrote more than 60 other books and hundreds of poems and articles on topics ranging from monastic spirituality to civil rights, nonviolent action, and the nuclear arms race.</p></p><h2>Little Infamies: Stories</h2><p><b>Cunning, fantastical tales about a Greek village of the imagination, from a startling new talent</b><br><br>Panos Karnezis' remarkable stories are all set in the same nameless Greek village. His characters are the people who live there--the priest, the whore, the doctor, the seamstress, the mayor--and the occasional animal: a centaur, a parrot that recites Homer, a horse called History. Their lives intersect, as lives do in a small place, and they know each other's secrets: the hidden crimes, the mysteries, the little infamies that men commit.<br><br>Karnezis observes his villagers with a worldly eye, and creates a place where magic invariably loses out to harsh reality, a place full of passion, cruelty, and deep reserves of black humor. These stories recall the masters of the form--the wit and sophisticated playfulness of Saki and the primal fatalism of Prosper Merimee--but they are utterly original and prove that Karnezis is one of the freshest new voices in English fiction.<br></p><p><b>Panos Karnezis</b> was born in Greece in 1967. He moved to England in 1992 to study engineering, and worked in industry before he started to write. He was awarded an MA in Creative Writing by the University of East Anglia.

He could not imagine then that the poor animal was only trying to warn him. Because no sooner had he washed his dish, fed the leftovers to the chickens, and sat on the veranda to drink a glass of wine, than a roar like the beating of an enormous vat echoed across the village. Father Yerasimo watched with fascination as his glass toppled, and the red wine spilled over the table. <br><br>`Shit!' he uttered. `It's the Second Coming.' <br><br>On the trees the crows suddenly took flight as if a gun had been fired, and a herd of sheep not far away bunched together and started bleating. Father Yerasimo crossed himself. The first tremor was as imperceptible as the dynamite detonations that reached the village from the penitentiary mines; it made the grid cables sway a little, and the canary banged its wings against the wires of its cage. The momentary shadow of a cloud that passed in front of the sun fell on Father Yerasimo's humble house, increasing his terror. And when the door to the veranda creaked on its hinges, he shivered like the time he had heard the hiss of a demon during one of his failed exorcisms. `Kyrie eleison me,' he whined, and touched the cross on his chest, remembering his pastoral failings. `It's not my fault. I have tried my best. But those heathens have the heads of mules.' <br><br>He had hardly finished his penance when the concrete veranda started rocking, as if it were floating on water. The pair of rubber galoshes in the corner, which he wore in winter to walk the few yards from home to the church, jumped up and down, and the swinging storm lantern on the wall rained paraffin on his threadbare cassock, but such was his shock that he did not move. <br><br>Then, as suddenly as it had started, the earthquake stopped. <br><br>For a while there was silence except for the occasional shattering of loose tiles slipping off roofs. The birds returned to the trees, while inside its cage the canary shrunk on its perch. In the square, in front of the church, people started arriving from every direction like a hunted herd. With them they carried the things they had salvaged from their homes: dishes of fake china, a shotgun with its cleaning rod, a wall clock whose cuckoo had fallen off its spring mechanism, the money from under the mattress, a still smoking Russian samovar, a bride-to-be her hired tulle gown, the mayor the cast-iron typewriter he had paid for with municipal funds, and someone else was pushing the bed with his sick grandparents still in it. <br><br>`The battle of Armageddon has begun!' Father Yerasimo shouted malevolently from his veranda. `Too late for you to repent now.' They looked at him, shamefaced. `Don't say I didn't warn you,' the priest added. <br><br>They were still in the square debating what to do when the terror returned. The earthquake announced its second attack by tolling the church bells, and although the belfry endured the subterranean violence, shaking like a fishing rod, the delicate mechanism of its clock did not, and its iron hands stopped at that hour of misfortune. The villagers could only watch as the ground beneath their feet tippled and the cypresses dropped their cones. The plaster of the murals inside the church broke up, and a moment later the big blue letters above the door of the town hall fell off one by one. Soon after the balcony slipped off its cantilevers too, and landed on the ground in one piece: floor, railing, flagpole and the deckchair in which the mayor used to take his afternoon naps. <br><br>The destruction continued among the laments of the villagers. Houses that found themselves in the path of the earthquake surrendered to its force: roofs caved in, chimneys toppled and blocked the streets, and adobe sheds disintegrated to piles of dust and straw. But the villagers had little time to grieve the loss of their property. Suddenly there was a noise of cracking stone and masonry, then a cloud of dust arose and from the cloud emerged the horns of a bolting cattle herd. <br><br>The people sought refuge inside the church of St Timotheo. A family of Jehovah's Witnesses, whom Father Yerasimo did not let in, climbed as high as they could on the cypresses in the courtyard, held tight to the dense branches and said their prayers, while underneath the cattle rushed past, heading towards the other end of the village. When the herd had disappeared, Father Yerasimo held his breath and discovered that the earthquake was also gone. He then carefully opened the church doors, looked left and right, and said with a sigh: `This village is drawn to misery like moths to a light.' <br><br>They had to count themselves three times to be sure that no one was missing and after that the people began work. The blacksmith assessed the damage to the church clock. He lconcluded that the only thing the mainspring and the wheels needed was straightening and the clock would be ticking again, but the village unanimously voted to leave it as it was, so that it would forever remind them of the disaster. Some men followed the barber to his shop, where they cleared the dust in the air with a pair of bellows from the smithy, stepped over the fallen crossbeams, moved the leather chair out of the way, and lifted the heavy panel with the carved cherubs that had come off the wall, already knowing what they would find underneath: of the exquisite mirror, which the barber had bought cheaply from a fading city beauty with an obsessive habit of counting her wrinkles, there remained only a heap of sharp, reflecting splinters. But nothing saddened the men more than the news they heard next: Sapphire's house on the edge of the village, the one with the whitewashed walls and the carmine shutters, the pots of basil and rosemary, and the half-open door with the horseshoe on, had turned into a pyramid of colourful rubble. Only Father Yerasimo was pleased: `At last,' he said, `the house of sin is cast into Hell.' <br><br>It was evening when the wind turned and they finally heard the shrieks of the peacocks that lived at the cemetery. When the crowd got there, lifted the twisted iron gate off its hinges and walked in, they discovered that the passing of the earthquake had not only split the ground into countless pits, broken the tombstones to pieces, and devastated the small glass shrines with the oil candles that had not been filled for years and the vases of dried-up amaranths that had never been watered, but also--and worst of all--had exhumed the coffins of their ancestors. <br><br>They tried to push the coffins back in but it was a vain effort, because as soon as they touched them the worm-eaten planks would crumble. So they decided to make new coffins. The men worked all night in the light of lanterns and all through the next day too, while the women were told to take out the bones, and mark them so they would not get mixed up. It was during this time that they chanced upon a coffin filled with books, and Father Yerasimo, embarrassed, hurried to explain that it was a pile of worthless paper filled with the lies of blasphemous and ignorant heretics. But they made other discoveries too: inside another coffin they found a complete telegraph system next to the remains of a man afraid of being buried alive, and in yet another they were puzzled to see a liver in perfect condition under the bleached bones of a notorious drunk; the doctor explained that it was the alcohol that had preserved it. <br><br>They had almost finished piling up the unearthed coffins when a particularly small one caught Father Yerasimo's eye. It was not its size that intrigued him, because he knew that death was often tempted by the helplessness of children in the village, but what its flaking coat of paint <br>up0revealed underneath: it was in fact a box for packing salted fish. But his greatest surprise came when, after using his shovel to break the rusty nails in its lid, and going down on his knees, he saw that rather than a child's remains the cheap wooden box contained eighteen heavy stones, each chiselled and polished to the unmistakable shape of a human heart. <br><br>It took two days to make the new coffins, and on the third the villagers, wearing crape made from women's garters, heard mass for the repose of the souls of the dead to the sound of cicadas. No sooner had Father Yerasimo said `Dust to dust' than they were all on the road home, leaving him alone in the cemetery but for the undertaker who started covering the graves. Standing in front of the box of stones the priest felt an overwhelming loneliness. No one could remember the exact location where it had been found--or they would not tell him. Father Yerasimo gave the box a frustrated kick. `A sin has been committed,' he said. `Some time ago I administered the last rites to a pile of stones.' <br><br>The cemetery was on top of a hill overlooking the village. The tombstones ruined by the earthquake had been made into a heap, and unadorned wooden crosses had taken their place. Father Yerasimo fed the corn and stale bread he had brought with him to the pair of peacocks before collecting their dropped feathers which he used to decorate the altarpiece. It was a day of clear and pleasant weather. Since the earthquake he had not been able to stop thinking about his mysterious discovery. During the two previous nights he had awoken with tears of mortal fear in his eyes, because he had dreamed of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by a rain of brimstone and an earthquake, while on the morning of the mass he had heard noise coming from the closet where his vestments hung; holding his cross in his trembling hand and whispering a prayer of exorcism he had opened it, only for an enormous rat to jump out. <br><br>He had considered these the machinations of the Devil, and soon convinced himself that the very earthquake itself ...</p><h2>Point of No Return: Point of No Return/Freedom&#39;s Run/Dark Passage/The Stranger&#39;s Message (Adventures in Odyssey Fiction Series 8-11)</h2><p>Fans of the long-running audio series Adventures in Odyssey can hardly remember a time when there wasn't a Connie or a Eugene&#x2015;or an Imagination Station.

He spells out what he means by an ethical approach to life, and shows that it can bring about significant and far-reaching changes to one&#39;s life.</p><p>Singer suggests that people who take an ethical approach to life often avoid the trap of meaninglessness, finding a deeper satisfaction in what they are doing than those people whose goals are narrower and more self-centered.

The &#39;group&#39; may be part of MI6, though Jacques will find no reference to it in any book; he will be called up to report on all types of people from politicians and celebrities, to ordinary citizens applying for bank loans. As Deza is drawn deeper into this twilight world of observation, Marias shows how trust and betrayal characterise all human relationships. How do we read people, and how far can the stories they tell about themselves be trusted when, by its very nature, all language betrays? Moving from the intimacy of Jacques&#39; marriage to the deadly betrayals of the Spanish Civil War, &#34;Your Face Tomorrow&#34; is an extraordinary meditation on our ability to know our fellow human beings, and to save ourselves from fever and pain.</p><p>Javier Marias was born in 1951.

He&#x2019;s charted more than a hundred country hits, including thirty-eight number ones. He&#x2019;s released dozens of studio albums and another half dozen or more live ones, performed upwards of ten thousand concerts, been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and seen his songs performed by artists as diverse as Lynryd Skynyrd, Elvis Costello, Tammy Wynette, Willie Nelson, the Grateful Dead, and Bob Dylan. In 2011 he was feted as a Kennedy Center Honoree. But until now, no one has taken an in-depth look at his career and body of work.</p><p>In Merle Haggard: The Running Kind, David Cantwell takes us on a revelatory journey through Haggard&#x2019;s music and the life and times out of which it came. Covering the entire breadth of his career, Cantwell focuses especially on the 1960s and 1970s, when Haggard created some of his best-known and most influential music, which helped invent the America we live in today. Listening closely to a masterpiece-crowded catalogue (including songs such as &#x201c;Okie from Muskogee,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sing Me Back Home,&#x201d; &#x201c;Mama Tried,&#x201d; &#x201c;Working Man Blues,&#x201d; &#x201c;Kern River,&#x201d; &#x201c;White Line Fever,&#x201d; &#x201c;Today I Started Loving You Again,&#x201d; and &#x201c;If We Make It through December,&#x201d; among many more), Cantwell explores the fascinating contradictions&#x2014;most of all, the desire for freedom in the face of limits set by the world or self-imposed&#x2014;that define not only Haggard&#x2019;s music and public persona but the very heart of American culture.</p></p><p>Music critic and longtime Haggard fan, David Cantwell is the coauthor of the acclaimed Heartaches by the Number: Country Music&#x2019;s 500 Greatest Singles, and his work has appeared in the Oxford American, Salon, and No Depression, among other publications."An incisive, critical analysis of one of the most complicated and misunderstood artists in country music...Both the Haggard fanatic and the casual country music fan will find their appreciation enriched." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2013-08-01)<br><br>"He recounts the high times when the Hag could seemingly do no wrong, as well as his lost decade of the 1990s, when the hot country radio format pushed the old man aside in favor of guys with hats and gals named Shania. Also of interest is a short chapter where Cantwell compares and contrasts the lives and careers of Hag and his contemporary Johnny Cash. 'Merle Haggard: The Running Kind&#x201d; gives this singular country artist his due and treats fans to a deep and appreciative trek through his songs." (<i>Hannibal Courier-Post</i> 2014-01-14)<br><br>"The Running Kind is one of those critical/biographical works that you will want to read again, so prepare yourself to succumb to its charms. It&#x2019;s worth it." (<i>PopMatters</i> 2014-05-13)<br><br>"My favorite is David Cantwell&#x2019;s book Merle Haggard&#x2014;The Running Kind."<br><br>"Since &#x2018;Okie from Muskogee&#x2019; was released in 1969 and made Haggard a lightning rod, he&#x2019;s been perhaps the most-written-about artist in country music history. Yet all that writing has been in periodicals. . . . Now here is a book that takes a serious look at Haggard&#x2019;s place in American culture and art, and that is no small thing. . . . This book is long overdue and will hopefully open up a dialogue on an artist who provides plenty of fodder."

Instead, it authorized the State of Texas to raise its own troops.<br><br>Many kinds of men drifted into the Texas Mounted Rifles. Some thought it might be safer than fighting in far off Virginia. Many were merely young men a-thirst for adventure. Some were settlers who saw this as the best way to protect their families and homes against the murderous thrusts of the Comanche. And some were men who still loved the Union, who had lived too long under that gallant flag to turn their guns against it now. Such a man was Scout Sam Houston Cloud...<br></p><p>Elmer Kelton (1926-2009) was the award-winning author of more than forty novels, including <i>The Time It Never Rained</i>, <i>Other Men&#x2019;s Horses</i>, <i>Texas Standoff</i> and <i>Hard Trail to Follow</i>. He grew up on a ranch near Crane, Texas, and earned a journalism degree from the University of Texas. His first novel, Hot Iron, was published in 1956. Among his awards have been seven Spurs from Western Writers of America and four Western Heritage awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. His novel <i>The Good Old Boys</i> was made into a television film starring Tommy Lee Jones. In addition to his novels, Kelton worked as an agricultural journalist for 42 years, and served in the infantry in World War II. He died in 2009.TEXAS RIFLES<br>OneCLOUD ALMOST RODE UPON THE INDIANS' GRAZING horse herd before he realized it.The summer sun had been bearing down upon him for hours now, sapping his energy, stealing from him the vigilance that he normally never lost while riding across these fringes of Comanche country. In this unrelenting heat it was easy to drowse in the saddle, to let one's mind roam the thousand miles and more to the smoky battlefields of Virginia.There, even now, angry cannons thundered and men died in the blast of shellfire.But here, in these rolling hills that marked the western edge of the Texas cross timbers, it was still and quiet ... so very quiet.He saw the horses and yanked hard on the hair reins, pulling his sorrel back into the green cover of post-oak brush. Suddenly wide awake, he whipped his rifle out ofits beaded deerskin scabbard. He stepped down quickly to the summer-dried grass and held his hand on the sorrel's nose to keep it from nickering. Cloud's heart hammered, his breath came short.Gradually he eased and got his lost breath back. Those Indians must have been as heat-sleepy as he was. They hadn't seen him.<i>That was just a shade too close to heaven!</i> he thought.He was a medium-tall man, crowding thirty. He was broad of shoulder, strong of back. Three days' growth of beard was beginning to blacken a face already browned by sun and wind. His large hands were leather-tough, for they had known the plow. Yet his legs showed a trace of a bow, too, because he had ridden a horse ever since he had been old enough to lace his fingers into a mane and hang on. He wore a sweat-streaked cotton shirt, buttoned at the loose-fitting collar to keep the sun from baking his breastbone. He carried a Colt revolver high on his right hip and a seven-pound bowie knife on his left, encased in a scabbard made from the hide of a buffalo's tail, the bushy black switch still hanging as a tassel.Through the screen of brush, Cloud studied the loose-held horse herd and the Indians who slacked in the shade of scattered trees around it. Comanches, mostly squaws. He could see only one man, on the near edge of the herd. The warrior slouched on a bay horse that showed the marks of a collar and a white man's brand on the hip. He hadn't spotted Cloud because he was giving his attention to a slender young squaw who sat as close to him as her black-maned dun would get. The warrior was laughing and talking with the woman while he rolled a fresh-made arrow shaft between his teeth, taking the sap out of it.These were horses a stray band of Comanche raiders had been picking up in the Texas settlements, Cloud reasoned. Now the wily thieves were working their way northto the safety of those trackless stretches of open grass on the Staked Plains, where they would lose themselves like a whirlwind that suddenly lifts and disappears into air, in a solitude so vast that white men drew back in dread.Counting in fives with tiny moves of his big hand, Cloud estimated that there were eighty or ninety horses. Many a farmer and cowman had been left afoot to walk and curse. More than likely, a few had lost their scalps as well as their horses. To the Comanche warrior stealing down from his stronghold on the high plains, warfare was a game to be played and enjoyed--an end in itself. To steal a <i>Tejano</i>'s horses brought material wealth and a considerable measure of honor. To count coup on the hated <i>Tejano</i> and bring back his scalp greatly increased the honor and raised the warrior's status in the eyes of the tribe.Cloud could still see only the one buck, and he wondered where the rest were. He counted six women, young squaws who remained physically able to make the long forays with their men, to do the menial chores and hold the horses and glory in the fighting manhood of their warriors. That there were six women didn't mean there were only six men, however. Many of the bucks never brought women on these trips. They didn't have to, for a Comanche warrior fortunate enough to have a woman with him thought little of lending her to a needful friend.The other men must be off somewhere trying to gather up more horses, Cloud reasoned. They must feel sure of themselves, leaving only one man with these squaws to watch the ones they already had. Either they had whipped back their pursuit or they considered it too far behind to worry about.<i>High time to h'ist my tail and get out of here</i>, he thought. <i>Only, which way had I ought to run? Wrongguess and I'll butt heads with Lord knows how many Comanches.</i>He was no stranger to Indian warfare. He'd had his scraps, and a deep scar on one shoulder to show for it. But he saw no sense in riding headlong into a one-sided battle where overwhelming weight of numbers was sure to grind him down.There was a time to fight and a time to ride away. Without question, this was a time to ride.He heard the heavy roar of a rifle from somewhere over the next hill, and he jerked involuntarily. The blast was followed by the staccato rattle of smaller guns. The horses lifted their heads, their ears pricking up in the direction of the gunfire. The buck and the squaws turned too, listening. The buck shook his head confidently to the young woman beside him. Telling her, Cloud judged, that it wouldn't take long.Cloud eased back afoot until he could no longer see the horses, and until he hoped the Indians could not see him. At least now he knew where the rest of the band was. Good chance to get away.But he was held by the sound of battle. Somebody across yonder was putting up a good fight.The trouble with being a reasonable man was that reason all the time wanted to argue with a man's emotions. Reason told Cloud to mount up and spur out of there while he could. But emotion made him wonder and worry about whoever the Comanches had bottled up. How much chance did those people have?Cloud skirted through the post oak, circled the horse herd and made his way up the off side of a hill, the rifle across his lap. Staying within brush cover, he climbed until he could look out across a clearing at the farmhouse below. It was pretty much the usual Texas frontier farmer's log cabin. Actually, it was almost two cabins, its two roomsbuilt under one roof but separated by a narrow, open "dog run." Each room was buttressed by a heavy rock chimney. Man with a family, Cloud figured. And most of them shooting.Defending fire racketed from three places--from each section of the cabin and from a heavy post-oak corral. The settler must have had a little warning, time enough to get his horses into the corral and shut the gate. To get them, the Indians were first going to have to kill him. Even then, they would be under close fire from the cabin. Heavy smoke rose from the man's position in the corral and drifted slowly away in the hot breeze.They sometimes said of Texas gunpowder that if the bullet didn't kill the enemy, the smoke would choke him to death.<i>He's in a good spot long's his powder holds out,</i> Cloud thought. <i>But there's four or five horses in that corral, and them Comanches can almost taste 'em.</i>He tried to rough-count the attacking Indians, but it was hard to spot them all. Some had found good cover in the tall grass. Others lay behind downed trees that the settler hadn't yet put into his fences. Ten or twelve, Cloud judged. A few were firing rifles. Most used bows. He could see the straight, quick flight of arrows, although at the distance he could not hear them strike the cabin or the timber that made up the corral.He saw an Indian sprint toward the house, then jerk in midstride, pitching headlong to the ground. That angered the others.<i>They're determined now,</i> he thought. <i>They'll Stay till they've got the job done.</i>He might be able to hit one or two of them from here with the long reach of his rifle, but he wasn't likely to change the situation much. They would dispatch a few warriors to take care of him while the rest went on afterthe people in the cabin. No use in a man selling out that cheap.He thought then of the horse herd.There was this about Comanches: they liked to fight, but they didn't care for suicide. If they saw they couldn't win, they usually pulled back. Cowardice was one thing, good judgment was another. Badly as they wanted those few horses in the corral, they probably would leave in a hurry if they thought they were in danger of losing the others they'd already taken, he reasoned. His one rifle wouldn't do a lot of good here, but it could cut a big swath out at that horse herd."Just hang on down there, folks," he muttered, backing away carefully. "The dance ain't over yet."In the saddle again, he circled back the way he had come. Using the brush to hide him, he made his way to the place from which he had first seen the horse herd. He stepped to the ground, taking his stake rope loose from the saddlehorn and working to the end of it, tying it about his waist with a slipknot. The other end was looped around the horse's nose beneath the bridle.Dropping to one knee, he steadied the rifle against the trunk of a post oak tree and drew a careful bead on the lone buck. He started to squeeze the trigger but hesitated, hating to. The thought of back-shooting sent a cold chill through him. But he knew the Indians didn't fight by rules.His sorrel chose that moment to stamp flies. The buck turned, bringing up a big old rifle. Cloud felt the man's eyes touch him, and he fired.The little squaw screamed as the man pitched forward on the horse's neck and slid to the ground. The horses nearest the shot shied into the rest of the band, creating a shock ripple like a stone dropped in water. Cloud drew his six-gun and fired once from where he was, then moveda little, staying in the brush. He aimed over the heads of the squaws on the far side and fired again. Now the horses were on the move away from Cloud. In panic, the squaws began pulling back. Waving their hands excitedly, they screamed at one another and hurried northward. Cloud fired a third time with the pistol.He knew they thought they had been found by a group of angry <i>Tejanos.</i> He sent another shot plowing into the ground near them, to keep them running.The horses were running now too, in a southerly direction. Cloud stopped to reload the rifle and put fresh charges in the pistol. That done, he coiled the stake rope and stepped onto the sorrel, the rifle slung over the saddlehorn, the pistol in his hand. He spurred in after the horses, firing occasionally, hollering, keeping them on the run.Ahead lay the heavy post oak timber. Get these horses scattered in there and it would take hours for the Comanches to round them up.A few of the horses split off to one side. Cloud elected to let them go, lest he allow the others to slow up and fall back into the hands of the Indians. He pulled up a moment to listen. The gunfire over the hill had stopped. Hearing the noise up here, the warriors probably had pulled back from the house and would be on their way here as fast as they could move. Cloud spurred up, yelling and firing the pistol, pushing his horses into a dead run that the Comanches couldn't stop.He made it. Looking back as he rode into the brush, he saw that the few horses he had lost were slowing down. But the bulk of the horse herd broke into the heavy timber just moments before the Indians bobbed up over the hill. Under cover, Cloud stepped down again with the heavy rifle in his right hand, the stake rope in his left. Again he looped the free end of the rope around his hips. Hedropped his reins and trotted to the end of the rope.Held close by the reins, a horse might shy at the roar of a rifle and jerk away, leaving its owner afoot. But when the shooter stood off at the end of the stake rope, a horse with any training usually took it with comparative calm. Should the horse begin to run and drag him, Cloud could yank the slipknot and free himself. But that was unlikely, for he had taught the sorrel to stand with the nose hitch.Dropping to one knee and leveling the rifle barrel over a limb, Cloud aimed at the Indian in the lead. He saw the dust puff in front of the man's horse. The Indian jerked the rein so hard that the horse stumbled and almost went down.Cloud moved twenty or thirty paces and took a long shot with the pistol. He didn't expect to hit anything at the range, but he could raise dust. The Indians hauled up and milled uncertainly. They plainly thought there were several Texans in the brush. He fired again with the pistol and took advantage of the moment to pour a small measure of gunpowder out of his powder horn into his palm. He followed this with a poured-lead bullet and a thin buckskin scrap for a bullet patch. He rammed it down tight, hardly taking his eyes off the Indians.For a moment it seemed they were going to come on down his way. He leveled the rifle again, drew a careful bead and squeezed. A horse went down, thrashing.That was enough. One of the Comanches reached down and pulled the unseated Indian up behind him. Then the whole pack put the heels to their mounts and began to run. They picked up the few horses Cloud had lost, but they were giving up the others.Cloud loaded the rifle again before he moved, and put fresh charges in the pistol. It looked clear now, but a man never could tell. That was likely to be a mighty mad bunch of Comanches. Losing a battle at that house yonder,losing their stolen horses. Now they would have to sneak back into camp like a bunch of squaws.Cloud coiled the stake rope as he moved toward his horse. He tucked the coils under his belt, where he could yank them out into use if there came a sudden need for the rope again. He eased into the saddle, still watching warily the dip in the hills where he had seen the Comanches disappear. The only thing a man could know for sure about Comanches was that they were likely to do what he didn't expect. Since he didn't expect them to come back, it was a good idea to watch.Staying in the brush as long as he could, he angled across toward the cabin he had seen. Good chance the Indians--some of them, anyway--were hanging back to see how many Texans were in that timber. An Indian might not be able to read, but he could blamed well count.Two hundred yards from the cabin the timber had all been cut away. Besides giving the settler material for his house and fences, this also afforded him a clear view of anyone approaching. It cut down the chance of surprise. But the farmer had left some of the tree trunks where they had fallen, and these had given the Indians some protection from rifle fire. Cloud would bet it wouldn't take the man long to drag these up into a pile.Moving into the clearing, he could feel the rifles trained on him, even though he couldn't see them. Two dogs set up an awful racket. "Hello the house!" Cloud called, keeping his hands up in clear sight and making no quick moves. Nobody answered him at first, but he saw a slight movement at a glassless window. Then a man stepped out from inside the corral.Cloud's sorrel snorted and shied away from a dead Indian the others had been in too big a hurry to pick up. Cloud stopped twenty paces from the corral. The two menstared at each other. Cloud finally opened the conversation with, "Howdy."The black-bearded man who stood there was in his late forties--fifty, maybe, for streaks of gray glistened in the sun.

It was a bestseller in many of the score of languages into which it was translated, but also criticized for describing clever people "so as to bring out their bad behavior" (Bernard Williams, <em>New York Review of Books</em>).</p><p>Paul Johnson now meets the charge with this companion volume of essays on outstanding and prolific creative spirits. He looks at writers from Chaucer and Shakespeare to Mark Twain and T. S. Eliot, artists like D�rer, and architects such as Pugin and Viollet-le-Duc. He explains the different ways in which Jane Austen, Madame de Stael, and George Eliot struggled to make their voices heard in the masculine hubbub. Victor Hugo allows him to ask, "Can imaginative genius coexist with low intelligence?" Johann Sebastian Bach gives him the opportunity to focus on the role of genetics in creativity and to explore the strange world of the organ loft. Louis Comfort Tiffany takes him into the technology of glass-making and the tragic vagaries of aesthetic fashion. Some essays make illuminating comparisons: of Turner with his contemporary the Japanese master Hokusai, and of the two great dress designers, Balenciaga and Dior. The final essay examines those two inventive geniuses, Picasso and Disney, and asks which had the greater influence on the visual arts of the twentieth century -- and beyond.</p><p>Paul Johnson believes that creation is a mysterious business that cannot be satisfactorily analyzed. But it can be illustrated in such a way as to bring out its salient characteristics. That is the purpose of this instructive and witty book.</p></p><p><p>Paul Johnson is a historian whose work ranges over the millennia and the whole gamut of human activities. He regularly writes book reviews for several UK magazines and newspapers, such as the <em>Literary Review</em> and <em>The Spectator</em>, and he lectures around the world. He lives in London, England.</p>Having in a previous book filleted intellectuals, conservative historian Johnson happily embraces the canon in search of artistic heroes. In 13 biographical sketches covering six centuries, he describes the masters of literature (Shakespeare), painting (D�rer), music (Bach) and adornment (Tiffany). His own efforts as a painter (mentioned with great modesty) add poignancy to his admiration for artists like Turner and Hokusai. Johnson emphasizes the rarity of truly visionary artists, but this is not a particularly polemical book: his enthusiasm for the creators overrides his tendency to play the gadfly. For Johnson, true genius resides not merely in native creativity but also in curiosity and industriousness. Many of his subjects were tremendously ambitious and prolific, with exceptions like Jane Austen serving to illustrate this all the more. Creation, says Johnson, is above all a vocation&#x2014;but it's also a business. It's striking that several of his subjects became quite wealthy&#x2014;he is particularly impressed with the riches Picasso amassed. Johnson's historical skills exceed his talents as a critic, but his approach is unfailingly generous, and his sections on <i>Hamlet </i>and Austen are genuinely revealing. <i>(Apr. 1)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Born in Ribottoli, Italy c. 1879, Rodia immigrated to the U.S. when he was about fifteen. In 1921, he purchased a triangular-shaped lot at the end of a dead-end L.A. street and over the next thirty years he worked single-handedly--without machine equipment, scaffolding, bolts, rivets, welds, or drawing-board designs--to build the nine sculptures that constitute the Watts Towers.<br><br> This book recounts the story of Rodia and his creation, as well as the considerable history of the Watts area itself. Other chapters discuss Rodia's building techniques and materials, as well as the conservation efforts underway at the site. Visitors to the Towers and the armchair traveler alike will enjoy this in-depth look at Rodia and his singular creation.</p><p></p><h2>Touching from a Distance: Ian Curtis &amp; Joy Division</h2><p>The only in-depth biographical accoutn of the lead singer of Joy Division, written by his widow.<br><br>Revered by his peers -- Bono described his voice as "holy" -- and idolized by his fans, Ian Curtis left behind a legacy rich in artistic genius.

But these problems can be solved if we draw on elements of our tradition that move us toward a new commonwealth&#x2015;a community founded on the well-being of all people and the natural world. In this brief, powerful, timely, and hopeful book, Jedediah Purdy, one of our finest writers and leading environmental thinkers, explores how we might begin to heal our fractured and contentious relationship with the land and with each other.</p><p>From the coalfields of Appalachia and the tobacco fields of the Carolinas to the public lands of the West, Purdy shows how the land has always united and divided Americans, holding us in common projects and fates but also separating us into insiders and outsiders, owners and dependents, workers and bosses. Expropriated from Native Americans and transformed by slave labor, the same land that represents a history of racism and exploitation could, in the face of environmental catastrophe, bind us together in relationships of reciprocity and mutual responsibility.</p><p>This may seem idealistic in our polarized time, but we are at a historical fork in the road, and if we do not make efforts now to move toward a commonwealth, Purdy warns, environmental and political pressures will create harsher and crueler conflicts&#x2015;between citizens, between countries, and between humans and the rest of the world.</p></p><p>A book based on the 2018 Humanities Lecture co-sponsored by Princeton University Press and the New York Institute for Humanities on the interwoven nature of the political and environmental crises.<b>Jedediah Purdy</b> is professor of law at Columbia Law School.

Mostly.</p><p>Jackie could see a blurred version of herself in the semipolished steel doors of the elevator car. Gray military uniform, black and blue stripes on the sleeves and pant legs. Black for the Space Force, blue for the Navy, gray for the Special Forces, the actual branch she had belonged to, once upon a time. A slight hint of red to her tanned face, proof of a few hours too many soaking up the sun on the local beaches over the holidays. Long brown curls coiled and pinned at the back of her head, below her officer&#x2019;s cap. Shiny twin silver bars on her lapels, shoulder boards, and shirt collar proclaiming her old rank of Lieutenant Commander. Medals decorating her chest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the buttons of her jacket straining to keep the coat properly closed.</p><p>Of course, it had been a decade since Jacaranda MacKenzie had been a Lieutenant Commander in the United Planets Space Force. For half of that decade, her job had been to sit in a chair and translate speeches for politicians&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and for the other half, it had been to sit in a chair as a politician, except for when she was standing and making speeches.</p><p>Exercise was therefore an imperative in her off-hours: mixed martial arts lessons three times a week, jogging every few days whenever she had free time and flat roads or good beaches, and, of course, swimming and surfing whenever possible, though that felt more like playing around than a proper workout. But it had been ten years since she <i>had</i> to stay in top shape, and the inevitable encroaching of middle age plus a decade of desk work had added a bit of padding to her frame.</p><p>So, if she didn&#x2019;t breathe too deeply, her jacket still fit.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t help that she&#x2019;d been given just four days&#x2019; notice of her reactivation, from New Year&#x2019;s Eve to now. That had barely been enough time to shut down her newly opened apartment on O&#x2019;ahu, repacking the few boxes she had unpacked. Just days before, she had moved out of her Councilor quarters on Kaho&#x2019;olawe, only to have to repack everything. All but her most immediate needs were now tucked into a storage unit in Honolulu.</p><p>Four days was barely enough time to repack and store things. It was not enough time to order and receive a new uniform. If she really was being reactivated for duty, she would have those new uniforms soon, but not right now. Right now, she had to remember to breathe lightly, and find an excuse to unbutton her jacket if she had to sit down.</p><p>The elevator stopped.</p><p>Taking a shallow breath to brace herself, Jackie stepped out of the lift and into a lobby-like space on the eighteenth floor. The sun didn&#x2019;t fall directly into the room through the greenish-tinted windows, but it did illuminate enough that the overhead lights weren&#x2019;t really needed. The waiting area held several potted plants, a dozen chairs and padded benches, a watercooler, flatpics of tropical flowers on the walls, a single, wood-paneled door aside from the metal ones for the lift&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and three people, besides herself.</p><p>Two of those were occupying a couple of the chairs, seated with a pair of empty seats between them in the way that said they were either polite strangers or mild acquaintances. The nearest one was a tallish, pale-skinned fellow with long, light blond hair pulled back in a ponytail and hazel eyes who sat with his elbows on his knees, clad in a neat, cream-colored suit with a pale yellow shirt decorated in white flowers with little green leaves.</p><p>The other seated figure was a woman with a complexion more olive than pale. She, too, sat there in a civilian suit, though hers was a dark, rich brown with a knee-length skirt and a plain pink shirt under the jacket. Her hair brushed her shoulders in big, dark, wavy curls, her features more Hispanic than Caucasian. Both of them looked around Jackie&#x2019;s age, midthirties.</p><p>A somewhat-younger-looking woman, the kind with classic African features, stood by the green-tinted windows. She was dressed in the blues of a well-fitted Space Force Navy uniform. Like Jackie&#x2019;s, her hair had been pinned up off her collar, but hers were neat columnar dreadlocks pulled back into a thick bun at the back of her head. Unlike Jackie, her overall figure was tall and slender.</p><p>The waiting room was high enough in the Tower that the view looked out over the edge of the caldera toward the northwestern side of the island. That was the side where everything had been left natural, an island desert made of reddish soil, scrubby sage-green bushes, and very few palm trees. Kaho&#x2019;olawe was in the rain shadow of the other islands, and under normal circumstances could not support a lot of life. Not on its untouched side.</p><p>As a native Hawai&#x2019;ian, Jackie thought it was beautiful. The eastern sides of the isles were lush and green, the most commonly seen version in all the tourism brochures, but not the rain-shadowed sides. Personally, she loved both views, and moved to stand by the windows so she could look out at the stark, colorful landscape, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Whoever thought <i>this</i> was a tropical paradise?&#x201d; the other woman murmured, gesturing at it briefly before refolding her arms. &#x201c;Look at it. Dry as dust, most of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The island&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Jackie murmured back. &#x201c;It just needs a little more water and some tender care to make it thrive. Like everything else in life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In other words, giving it a little <i>aloha</i>?&#x201d; the other lieutenant commander observed dryly.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s called Aloha City,&#x201d; Jackie agreed. Everyone knew the story of how the capital had been picked.</p><p>Back in the year 2113, when the various governments of the world had argued, even nearly fought, for the honor of hosting the capital of the then newly formed United Planets government, the natives of the Hawai&#x2019;ian Islands had worked together to put an end to the arguing. The concept was <i>aloha</i>, which meant more than just <i>hello</i>, or <i>good-bye</i>, or even <i>I love you</i>. It also meant bringing people together in compassion and cooperation. To share, rather than divide. To welcome, rather than to spurn.</p><p>Her mother&#x2019;s ancestors had pointed out that the nearly barren, mostly unused island of Kaho&#x2019;olawe was about as far away from any large landmass&#x2014;and thus any big political influence&#x2014;as any location could possibly get, while still being reasonably close to major metropolitan conveniences on the other islands, such as nearby Maui, O&#x2019;ahu, and the Big Isle. The land, they said, would be leased at generously low rates, and the architecture would be built to blend into the southern side&#x2019;s augmented landscape from the ridgeline down to the shoreline, providing a relaxing setting for weary civil servants to enjoy at the end of each stressful day.</p><p>According to Jackie&#x2019;s late grandfather, a Councilor who had served for many years, the real selling point had been reminding everyone that it was a <i>tropical paradise</i>, and thus an ideal location for dignitaries to visit. That, he swore, had finally convinced the major political powers to agree to place the capital there. The idea of getting to spend time there during the Fellowship Lottery had convinced the general populations of the world as well. All-expenses-paid visits to a tropical paradise certainly did not hurt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but those buildings were on the other side of the caldera from the waiting room&#x2019;s current northward view of desert-dry hills and tufts of bushes.</p><p>While irrigation ruled the southern half, the locals had encouraged the new government to take over <i>only</i> half of the island, leaving the other half untouched for their continuing cultural use. They had even footed the bill for the desalination plants that had turned the lower half of the island into the irrigated tropical paradise her paternal grandfather had so admired during his years as Councilor for Scotland back in his own day. All that, in return for a very modest set of rental fees and very strict regulations on what could be built, where it could be built, and from what materials. Southern Kaho&#x2019;olawe looked like a lush, green, tropical paradise, a flower-filled, greenery-cloaked delight to the senses of its many visitors. The barren northern side of the isle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was its true face.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d almost rather be looking at star charts.&#x201d; The other woman sighed. She had a faint accent, one that Jackie couldn&#x2019;t yet place.</p><p>The angle was wrong to read the other woman&#x2019;s nameplate. Jackie gave up trying to peek discreetly at it and just used the title that went with that blue uniform and the twin silver bars on those collar points. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather look at all of this, Lieutenant Commander. I spent nearly five years touring the outer edges of the system, back when I last served. This is a lot more colorful than staring at black space broken only by the tiny pinpricks of distant stars.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just like the view of the capital side better,&#x201d; the lieutenant commander demurred. &#x201c;Even if it&#x2019;s tiny, compared to my home town of Yaounde&#x2014;Yaounde Prefecture, inside Cameroon Province,&#x201d; she clarified.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m local-born, so, I guess I&#x2019;m biased toward the dry as well as the green sides of the isles around here,&#x201d; Jackie said, shrugging. <i>Yaounde, Cameroon. That means her accent is Ewondo mixed with French, which was what was throwing me off,</i> she decided.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t blame the woman for calling Aloha City small. Compared to a landlocked metropolis like Yaounde, Aloha City had nowhere to sprawl once it had covered the southern shoreline, and there were prohibitions about building too high. All they could do was build down, hiding a lot of the city&#x2019;s infrastructure that way.</p><p>There were a few exceptions on not building too high; the Tower was one, the tallest structure on the isle, though it was quite short compared to other buildings elsewhere on Earth. The heart of the Space Force had been designed to look like olivine, the green crystal that made certain nearby beaches famous for their green sand. The Lotus was another; more formally known as the Council Hall, it had been sculpted from white metal and golden glass as a giant sphere with a petal motif. There were a few other spectacular buildings, but most of the rest of the main buildings and support infrastructures were either designed to blend into the palm trees on the south side, or were built into and beneath the caldera here at the eastern end of the island but built to remain low in profile.</p><p>Subtly tugging at her Dress Grays to try to make the jacket front look straight and neat like the other woman&#x2019;s deep blue version, Jackie wondered just what sort of place she&#x2019;d be sleeping in by the end of tonight. Her orders had been to prepare for a long absence from her current home and to show up ready to travel at the Tower&#x2019;s eighteenth-floor lobby. So here she was, luggage in her rental car in the garage down belowground, ready to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wait for more orders, apparently.</p><p>&#x201c;View or no view, <i>I</i> do not like to be kept waiting.&#x201d; The seated woman in the brown outfit sighed, echoing Jackie&#x2019;s thoughts at least somewhat. Her accent held a Spanish lilt to it. &#x201c;There are far more useful things I could be doing right now.&#x201d;</p><p>The blond, long-haired male seated near her spoke up as well. &#x201c;When <i>I </i>have to wai&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The elevator dinged, cutting him off. All four of them turned to look at the metal doors. The man who emerged wore the same Navy-blue uniform that the woman did, if with only one bar for his insignia. A lieutenant.</p><p>He was fair, if somewhat tanned, his blond hair cropped in a buzz cut under his Dress cap. The newcomer&#x2019;s strong stride spoke of constantly exercised strength, too; this was no desk jockey of a junior officer. Jackie would have bet from his tightly contained energy that he didn&#x2019;t just go on long runs to stay in shape; he probably went on them to have fun, like she went surfing to have fun. Only much more frequently.</p><p>Her gaze moved to his upper chest. The name patch said <i>Colvers</i>. A glance at the woman showed her wearing two silver bars, a Lieutenant Commander, just like Jackie. The woman, whose name tag was now visible, was Mbani. The woman lifted her chin at the newcomer, greeting him with some familiarity.</p><p>&#x201c;Happy New Year, Brad. I was wondering if it&#x2019;d be you,&#x201d; the lieutenant commander said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ayinda,&#x201d; he greeted her, then glanced at Jackie, his gaze first going to her naturally tanned, round face, to her reddish-brown curls pulled ruthlessly into a coiled braid, then down to her insignia and scattering of medals from her years of service. &#x201c;Lieutenant Comman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Colvers stopped midword, staring at the Psi Division flashpatch affixed to her jacket&#x2019;s right shoulder. The Radiant Eye was a symbol of the Psi League, but the military&#x2019;s psychic corps had commandeered a version of it. There was the horizontal ellipsis outlining an eye shape, and a circle-within-a-circle for the iris and the pupil, plus the eight rays emanating from the center of the pupil. But the curves that outlined the outer edge of the iris were actually made from the curves of a laurel wreath. Eyeing the black-on-silver design of her flashpatch, the lieutenant&#x2019;s lip curled up, and he backed up a step.</p><p>Jackie wasn&#x2019;t unfamiliar with that kind of reaction to that particular patch on her sleeve. Mbani, however, arched her brow at that. &#x201c;You have a problem with courtesy, Lieutenant?&#x201d;</p><p>The youngish man looked like he wanted to say, <i>Yes, very much so</i>, at least where it pertained to Jackie in her not-quite-perfect uniform. But after a moment, he swallowed it down, though he remained several meters back. &#x201c;Sir, no, sir. Greetings, Lieutenant Commander&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. MacKenzie,&#x201d; he stated, his eyes flicking to her nameplate before shifting away again. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know what a <i>psi</i> is doing here, mingling with Navy personnel.&#x201d;</p><p>Jackie frowned in puzzlement.

But the dreams invasive images of blood and brutality torture her, driving Yeong-hye to purge her mind and renounce eating meat altogether. It s a small act of independence, but it interrupts her marriage and sets into motion an increasingly grotesque chain of events at home. As her husband, her brother-in-law and sister each fight to reassert their control, Yeong-hye obsessively defends the choice that s become sacred to her. Soon their attempts turn desperate, subjecting first her mind, and then her body, to ever more intrusive and perverse violations, sending Yeong-hye spiraling into a dangerous, bizarre estrangement, not only from those closest to her, but also from herself. <br> Celebrated by critics around the world, "The Vegetarian" is a darkly allegorical, Kafka-esque tale of power, obsession, and one woman s struggle to break free from the violence both without and within her."</p><p>Han Kang was born in 1970 in South Korea.

Elle.com <br> "The Vegetarian" is the first there will be more, let s hope of Han Kang s novels to arrive in the United States The style is realistic and psychological, and denies us the comfort that might be wrung from a fairy tale or a myth of metamorphosis. We all like to read about girls swapping their fish tails for legs or their unwrinkled arms for branches, but at the risk of stating the obvious a person cannot become a potted bit of green foodstuff.

Shelf Awareness <br> A horror story in its depiction of the unknowability of others of the sudden feeling that you've never actually known someone close to you .Its three-part structure is brilliant, gradually digging deeper and deeper into darker and darker places; the writing is spare and haunting; but perhaps most memorable is its crushing climax, a phantasmagoric yet emotionally true moment that's surely one of the year's most powerful. This is an ingenious, upsetting, and unforgettable novel. "Publishers Weekly" (starred review) <br>"[A] spare, spectacular novel...Family dysfunction amid cultural suffocation is presented with elegant precision, transforming readers into complicit voyeurs.

Han writes convincingly of the disruptive power of longing and the choice to either embrace or deny it, using details that are nearly fantastical in their strangeness to cut to the heart of the very human experience of discovering that one is no longer content with life as it is.An unusual and mesmerizing novel, gracefully written and deeply disturbing." "Kirkus" <br>"Searing...[Yeong-hye's]extreme efforts to separate herself from her animal appetites reveal the sanity and normality of those closest to her to be mere matchstick houses." Helen Oyeyemi, author of "Boy, Snow, Bird" <br>"Suffused with a sensibilitythat evokes the matter-of-fact surrealism of Franz Kafka, featuring a female protagonist as engagingly perverse as Melville s Bartleby, Han Kang s slender but robust novel addresses many vital matters from the politics of gender to the presumptions of the male gaze, the conundrum of free will to the hegemony of meat with a dark elan that vegetarians and carnivores alike will find hypnotic, erotic, disquieting, and wise.

Han holds the reader in a vice grip..."The Vegetarian"quickly settles into a dark, menacing brilliance that is similar to the work of the gifted Japanese writer Yoko Ogawa in its devastating study of psychological pain..."The Vegetarian"is more than a cautionary tale about the brutal treatment of women: it is a meditation on suffering and grief. It is about escape and how a dreamer takes flight. Most of all, it is about the emptiness and rage of discovering there is nothing to be done when all hope and comfort fails....A work of savage beauty and unnerving physicality." "Irish Times" <br> "The Vegetarian "is a book about the failures of language and the mysteries of the physical. Yet its message should not undermine Han s achievement as a writer.

Joanna Walsh, "The New Statesman" <br> [A] strange and ethereal fable, rendered stranger still by the cool precision of the prose What is ultimately most troubling about Yeong-hye s post-human fantasies is that they appear to be a reasonable alternative to the world of repression and denial in which everyone around her exists. "Times Literary Supplement" <br>""The Vegetarian" is so strange and vivid it left me breathless upon finishing it. I don t think I ve ever read a novel as mouth-wateringly poetic, or as drenched in hypnotic oddities, taboos and scandal.

Thirty-eight members of the MacDonald clan are killed by soldiers who had previously enjoyed the clan's hospitality. Many more die from exposure. Forty miles south, the captivating Corrag is imprisoned for her involvement in the massacre. Accused of witchcraft and murder, she awaits her death. Lonesome, she tells her story to Charles Leslie, an Irish propagandist who seeks information to condemn the Protestant King William, rumored to be involved in the massacre. Hers is a story of passion, courage, love, and the magic of the natural world. By telling it, she transforms both their lives.</p><p>As in her award-winning debut novel, <em>Eve Green</em>, Susan Fletcher shows that she is "a novelist with the soul of a poet" (<em>Booklist</em>). This deeply philosophical and dramatic book is about an epic historic event and the difference a single heart can make&#x2015;how deep and lasting relationships can come from the most unlikely places.</p></p><p>Susan Fletcher is the author of Eve Green, which won the Whitbread Award for First Novel, Oystercatchers, and The Highland Witch. She lives in the United Kingdom.The plight of an accused witch in late 17th-century Britain inspires confusion, then pity, in her only visitor in Fletcher's engrossing historical (after Oystercatchers). The only witness to the massacre of the MacDonald clan, Corrag sits in a village jail under a death sentence for her supposed supernatural involvement in the killings. Her interrogator is Charles Leslie, a Catholic loyalist traveling in disguise who is seeking information that may implicate the Protestant king William in the murders. Corrag leads Charles through her lonely childhood: her mother hanged for witchcraft, Corrag fled her hometown and lived hand to mouth before gaining the protection of the MacDonald clan. Corrag spins colorful if sometimes meandering tales of the unfriendly English countryside and the fleeting joy of having found, in the clan, a place where she can be accepted; Charles is harder to pin down, and he often functions as a placeholder until his abrupt shift into a pivotal role late in the book. Fletcher gives readers a strong plot, enough vivid passages to compensate for the occasional dull spot, and a triumphant heroine in Corrag, whose travails are truly epic. (Nov.)

These jazz pioneers, including instrumentalists, composers, and vocalists, were products of the Puerto Rican diaspora in the United States and contributed to the early history of this uniquely American genre.<p></p> In this study, author Basilio Serrano provides a detailed look at the lives of these men and women and their contributions to the development of jazz and Latin jazz. Serrano explores how the music of Puerto Rico helped to shape them and offers a comprehensive review of the bands in which they played, studying specialists in a variety of instruments as well as band leaders and composers. This group included notable figures such as Fernando Arbello, the Bayron sisters, the Rivera family, Louis King Garcia, Joe Loco, Juan and Paco Tizol, Augusto and Willie Rodriguez, Augusto Coen, and Cesar Concepcion.<p></p> Covering a period from 1900 to 1939, <i>Puerto Rican Pioneers in Jazz, 1900&#x2013;1939</i> presents the stories of early Puerto Rican jazz musicians whose contributions to the genre have previously been overlooked.<p></p></p><p><p><b>Basilio Serrano</b> is originally from Puerto Rico. Educated in New York, he holds a PhD in curriculum and instruction from New York University. He has been a faculty member at Brooklyn College and the State University of New York College at Old Westbury.

I spent&nbsp; my first four- teen years living in Interlaken, New Jersey. It&#x2019;s an upper-middle-class island&nbsp; in the middle&nbsp; of Deal Lake, just&nbsp; one town inland&nbsp; from&nbsp; the summer&nbsp; seaside resort of Asbury Park in its glory days. My family was one of a handful&nbsp; of Jews who lived there. I was four and a half years old when I realized I wasn&#x2019;t a boy, and therefore must be a girl. I still lived the life of a boy. People still saw me as a boy, and later as a man&#x2014;and I never had the courage to correct them. Instead, I lied to everyone, telling them I was a boy. Day and night, I lied. That&#x2019;s a lot of pressure&nbsp; on a little kid.<br><br>-----<br> &nbsp;<br> The Saturday Evening Post arrived each week, by mail. Norman Rock- well, craftsman&nbsp; of the American dream, painted most of the covers. I longed&nbsp; to be each&nbsp; and&nbsp; every one&nbsp; of those&nbsp; corn-fed midwestern freckle-faced Rockwell girls&#x2014;engaging,&nbsp; grinning&nbsp; in the face of adversity, defiant, weeping with the loss of love, dependent on the men in her&nbsp; life. Rockwell girls are especially dependent on daddy. And they were blonde.&nbsp; Oh, how I wanted&nbsp; eyes the color of cornflowers and hair the color of fresh-picked corn.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, here&#x2019;s&nbsp; a cover that&nbsp; Norman&nbsp; Rockwell would&nbsp; never&nbsp; have painted: my mother&nbsp; on the delivery table, knocked out from not only<br> the anesthesia,&nbsp; but also the pitcher of martinis&nbsp; she&#x2019;d drunk over the course of her six hours&#x2019; labor with me. I was born drunk and loving drugs. The first words I heard were, &#x201c;Welcome to this world, honey. Welcome.&#x201d; Twenty-four years later, the same doctor&#x2014;Griff Grimm&#x2014; would hold newborn&nbsp; Jessica and&nbsp; say those&nbsp; same&nbsp; words. Griff and my dad&nbsp; were resident&nbsp; physicians&nbsp; at Fitkin&nbsp; Memorial&nbsp; in&nbsp; Neptune, New Jersey&#x2014;a small hospital serving a cluster of small seaside sum- mer towns.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Living on the Jersey Shore, the Atlantic Ocean was our magic, and the boardwalk was our magic carpet. Summertime meant&nbsp; sharing that with the tourists&#x2014;we all had summer jobs that depended on the tourists.&nbsp; In a summer&nbsp; town, the father-son bonding&nbsp; seasons are autumn, winter, and early spring.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; My dad and I bonded over old-school pro wrestling&#x2014;we shared that fandom.&nbsp; Dad had once been the Indiana&nbsp; State College Middle- weight Wrestling Champion.&nbsp; He took me to the pro matches&nbsp; in As- bury Park&#x2019;s Convention Hall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Remember,&nbsp; Albert,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say to me, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s all an act. But there&#x2019;s a lot of skill in making it look real.&#x201d; I knew that already. I had a lot of skill in making myself look and act like a real boy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; My father&nbsp; was a doctor, so we could afford to sit ringside.&nbsp; He rarely stayed seated. Dad was up on his feet most&nbsp; of the time&#x2014;as close to the ring as he could get&#x2014;shaking&nbsp; his fist and bellowing at the bad guys, or at the referee&nbsp; for a bad call. That was his anger. He showed some of it at home, but ringside he really let go. My dad thought&nbsp; he saw me, his son, caught up in the bloodlust of the sport. Nah. It was plain old lust for me. I watched those matches shivering in sexual turn-on. Pre-match, the wrestlers would strut&nbsp; around&nbsp; the ring. One for one, the good guys always gave me a wink. They gave everyone a wink, but I took it personally. When they winked at me, I was a beautiful&nbsp; young girl and I longed to be caught&nbsp; up in their arms. Any bonding&nbsp; my dad and I did over wrestling, or fishing, or baseball was&#x2014;like everything else in my life&#x2014;based on the lie that<br> I was a boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> -----<br> &nbsp;<br> Paul Kenneth Bornstein, MD<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the name,&nbsp; hand-painted on the pebbled-green-glass office door to my father&#x2019;s medical office on the second floor of the Medical Arts Building in Asbury Park. When I turned&nbsp; thirteen&nbsp; and became a man, I was told that one day my name would be painted right underneath&nbsp; his, and we&#x2019;d share a practice together. It never occurred to me to question that future, and besides, I never argued with my dad. My big brother&nbsp; and I called him dad. Only girls called their fathers daddy. Dad&#x2019;s patients&nbsp; called him&nbsp; Doc&#x2014;so did most&nbsp; of the&nbsp; trades- people and store clerks up and down the shore. To them, I was Doc&#x2019;s son, as in &#x201c;Doc&#x2019;s son is here for the prescription,&#x201d;&nbsp; or &#x201c;You got those roast beef subs ready for Doc&#x2019;s son?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Hey, Doc&#x2019;s son is here delivering Christmas&nbsp; presents.&#x201d;&nbsp; Yes, we were Jews but back then&nbsp; we weren&#x2019;t supposed&nbsp; to shout&nbsp; about&nbsp; it. We celebrated&nbsp; Christmas,&nbsp; not Hanukkah. I was bar mitzvahed&nbsp; but, as I&#x2019;ve mentioned and as you may have noted . . . it didn&#x2019;t work.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; My dad&#x2019;s parents immigrated from Russia&#x2014;or Poland&#x2014;or what- ever they were calling that strip of land that drifted back and forth. I don&#x2019;t know my family&#x2019;s town of origin, but growing up, I heard vague references&nbsp; to Minsk&nbsp; and&nbsp; Pinsk.&nbsp; Minsk, Pinsk, someone&nbsp; would say, and Uncle Davy would unconsciously rub the camp number tattooed on his forearm. He always wore long sleeves. Minsk, Pinsk, someone would say, and invariably someone&nbsp; would recite &#x201c;The Ballad of Max and Anna Come to America.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Max and Anna, my father&#x2019;s parents, were age fourteen and twelve respectively. They were lovers who together&nbsp; supported&nbsp; the&nbsp; radical Red Russian&nbsp; forces seeking to overthrow the czar. Young Max was captured&nbsp; by the White Russians&#x2014;forces&nbsp; of the czar, not unlike the Stormtroopers&nbsp; in Star Wars.

In his 34th Discworld novel, Terry Pratchett is at the top of his game, taking on honest cops, vampires, loyalty, fatherhood, and, of course, historic battlefield reenactments to create yet another irreverent, adventure-filled yarn. Gleefully finding both the parody and distinctive voice in each character, Stephen Briggs has a rip-roaring time creating a cornucopia of goofy British Isle accents. Briggs adds the right vocal tension and gravity at the right times as Commander Sam Vimes and the City Watch (a police force that dons "one size doesn't fit anybody" helmets) attempt to bring the murderer of four subterranean dwarfs to justice before another interspecies game of Thud! becomes all too real.

Detailed diagrams of the signs are included so that readers can learn along with Manuel.<br><br>A Junior Library Guild Selection<br><br></p><p><br><b>Isaac Millman</b> is the author and illustrator of three other books about Moses ("[A] great contribution," praised<i> School Library Journal</i>). He lives in New York City.<br><br>Kindergarten-Grade 3-In this engaging installment in the series about a hearing-impaired boy, Moses's class is joined by a group of hearing children from another school and the students are treated to a production of <i>Cinderella</i> by the Little Theatre of the Deaf. As the two classes intermingle prior to entering the gym, Moses meets Manuel, a new immigrant who does not yet speak English. The two boys develop a rapport, especially since "Moses knows how lonely it can be when no one understands you," and they communicate through gestures. The performance of the immediately recognizable fairy tale makes the signs and body language of the actors more accessible to both the children within the story and to readers. Insets in most of the spreads show Moses and later the performers demonstrating relevant American Sign Language. The colorful artwork is filled with enthusiastic kids with expressive features set against realistic school backdrops. This book not only familiarizes and sensitizes children to the culture of the deaf or hard-of-hearing community, but also tells an appealing story. Millman draws a parallel between the challenges faced by ESL students and those who do not hear and in so doing raises youngsters' general levels of awareness and empathy.<i>-Rosalyn Pierini, San Luis Obispo City-County Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Boyce became a pastor, then a university professor, and finally the founder and first president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he taught theology from 1859 until his death in 1888. Throughout his ministry Boyce insisted on the importance of theological education for all ministers. In a preface, he described his Abstract of Systematic Theology, published the year before his death, as follows: "This volume is published the rather as a practical text book, for the study of the system of doctrine taught in the Word of God, than as a contribution to theological science."</p><h2>The Joy Luck Club</h2><p>This novel, told from the viewpoints of four Chinese mothers and their four American-Chinese daughters, examines the nature of the mother-daughter relationship, and the problems of cultural identity the characters face.</p><p>Four mothers, four daughters, four families whose histories shift with the four winds depending on who's "saying" the stories. In 1949 four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, begin meeting to eat dim sum, play mahjong, and talk. United in shared unspeakable loss and hope, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Rather than sink into tragedy, they choose to gather to raise their spirits and money. "To despair was to wish back for something already lost. Or to prolong what was already unbearable." Forty years later the stories and history continue. <p> With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.</p>A collection of literature anthologies and reference books for Key Stage 3 onwards.</p><h2>Senior Girl&#39;s Guide to Girl Scouting</h2><p>Official Girl Scout Guide Book A colorful, easy-to-use binder specially designed for girls at each level.

Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

In <i>The Ships of Air</i> (2004), the Gardier, revealed as hailing from yet another world, are revealed to be using magic they don't completely understand, and Ile-Rien's defenders learn enough to defeat the Gardier. Now, in <i>The Gate of Gods</i>, Tremaine Valiarde and her comrades have found a hidden Gardier base and hints of what may stop them, though it calls for jumping near blindly through more sorcerous gates, and Ile-Rien is running out of time. Wells shows us some very convincing characters in a desperate situation: attacked without warning, their usual weapons made ineffective, and with allies sometimes as strange as their enemies. The plot is very complex, so start the trilogy at the beginning. <i>Frieda Murray</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Hazen is Associate Professor of Comparative Religion and Christian Apologetics at Biola University and Director of the Graduate Program in Christian Apologetics. He earned a B.A. from California State University, Fullerton; studied law and theology at the International Institute for Law and Theology in Strasbourg, France; and earned an M.A. and Ph.D. in religious studies from the University of California at Santa Barbara. Dr. Hazen is the author of The Village Enlightenment in America: Popular Religion and Science in the Nineteenth Century (University of Illinois Press) and editor of the philosophy journal Philosophia Christi. His academic work has received multiple awards for excellence from the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Religion. His articles have appeared in Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation, Journal of Christian Apologetics, and the Proceedings of the International Congress of the History of Science, among others. The flamboyant governor of Minnesota, former theatrical wrestler and Navy SEAL Jesse "the body" Ventura said in a highly publicized and provocative interview that he considered religious people to be inherently "weak-minded" folk. By doing so he was parroting a popular notion of arm-chair agnostics that people who embrace religion are gullible and needy; they are people willing to give up all or a certain amount of rationality in order to have their emotional needs met by some type of spirituality or superstition. A furor ensued in his state, and his popularity rating plunged, but to some extent the governor&#x2019;s remark had some basis in reality. Many get the same impression very quickly by talking to the rank-and-file devotees in most religious movements. The average believer generally does not have the training or the interest in articulating or defending a coherent, systematic worldview that captures and makes sense of his or her faith. This is certainly true with regard to the movements that are addressed in this essay, evangelical Christianity and Mormonism. Both movements have been characterized as anti-intellectual, and detractors have not been slow with insults to both groups along those lines. What both Christians and Mormons in North America know, though, is that those who characterize and insult the groups in this way are themselves not particularly well informed. In both modern American evangelicalism and Mormonism there are significant pockets of believers who are scholars and thinkers, people who are committed to making a vigorous defense of their respective faiths based on reason and on the very best evidence. Whether the case these thinking believers make is sound and persuasive is another question, but the fact that there are LDS and evangelical Christian scholars who would very much like to show that their belief systems are eminently reasonable is not up for dispute. The accusation of anti-intellectualism and gullibility on the part of believers was especially rife in the early years of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As religious historian Jan Shipps put it, outsiders saw Mormonism pandering "to the superstitious, the gullible, and the fearful." They would accuse "Mormonism of &#x2018;blinding&#x2019; its adherents so effectively that when they heard Smith&#x2019;s report of his visions and his explanation of the origins of the Book of Mormon, they could not distinguish truth from falsehood." Just a month after the publication of the Book of Mormon, newspaper editors like Abner Cole of the Palmyra, New York, Reflector began the lampooning and discrediting of the new "Gold Bible," Joseph Smith (1805&#x2013; 44), and his followers. Mormon historian Richard L. Bushman correctly noted that early on there was simply an assumption that "they had to be dull because it was axiomatic that superstition flourished in ignorance." That there were undiscerning converts to Joseph Smith&#x2019;s new religion in the nineteenth century is a given. That they were all, or even mostly such, is a myth. Clearly, there was an advantage to early opponents of the Mormon movement&#x2019;s slapping a pejorative label on those who chose to join. It made the overall task of response and refutation much easier and perhaps more effective. Some adversaries at the time went so far as to claim that Joseph Smith was adept at the power of "animal magnetism" or "fascination" and hence could wield undue influence over the minds of potential converts. These kinds of characterizations held on for years. Esteemed Mormon historian Leonard J. Arrington tried to gauge popular views of the movement in the nineteenth century by examining fiction that involved the Latter-day Saints in the plot line. He discovered that almost every one of the fifty novels that described Mormon life saw the people as incurably ignorant if not also lecherous and depraved. One can not make full sense of the initial rise of Mormonism without recognizing that there were strong elements in it that resonated with thoughtful people on the frontier. I do not mean by this that the "rational" element was the only factor, perhaps it was not even the primary or secondary factor to which one can attribute the success of the early LDS movement. But for many at the time there was undoubtedly a logic to it and certainly enough cultural resonance of a rational sort in the message of the Mormon "restoration" of Christianity to attract intelligent, reflective people. Of course, I am not talking here about professors, academics, or trained scholars&#x2014;there were none in the early LDS Church. But here I would make the same point that social anthropologist Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah and historian of Mormonism D. Michael Quinn both make: that we should be sure to carve out a "distinction between the academic and the folk, not between intelligent and unintelligent." We are discussing here very bright but not highly educated people on the frontier who were unwilling to join a religious movement without what they thought were good reasons.</p><h2>Fluxus Codex</h2><p>Fluxus was an art movement of the 1960s and 70s that set out to abolish the canonized art idioms of the day. Pioneers of Conceptual Art and Minimalism, the Fluxus artists were known for their environments, performance art and mass-producible objects. This book is a study of the Fluxus movement.</p><p>The Fluxus movement melded the tricks of Dada, the economy of Conceptualism and the collectivist spirit of Russian Constructivism to produce deliberately ephemeral and easily forgettable works. Fluxus artists made some witty, subversive objects, like Joe Jones's Violin in Bird Cage . To challenge our conventional notions, they created transparent dresses, a box filled with chromed earthworms, dollar-bill toilet paper, collections of rocks marked by weight, ceiling hatches, fashion handbills, "Here I Come" sweatshirts. Claes Oldenburg, Yoko Ono, Willem de Ridder and the group's "resident genius" George Maciunas were among the experimenters in the Fluxus orbit. Their inventions are much less revolutionary than the artists seem to think they are, more like private jokes than disturbing works of art. Hendricks is curator of the Lilia and Gilbert Silverman Fluxus collection, which this hefty tome catalogues. Its dictionary format with thousands of entries is well suited to the motley anarchy of this group. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Destroyer: Created, The Destroyer #1</h2><p>The Destroyer #1 Created, The Destroyer by Richard Sapir and Warren Murphy</p><p></p><h2>Rules of Civility</h2><p><b>Unabridged, 9 CDs, 11 1/2 hours</b><br><br> Read by TBA<br><br> A sophisticated and entertaining debut novel about an irresistible young woman with outsized dreams.<br><br></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2011</strong> Set during the hazy, enchanting, and martini-filled world of New York City circa 1938, <em>Rules of Civility</em> follows three friends--Katey, Eve, and Tinker--from their chance meeting at a jazz club on New Year's Eve through a year of enlightening and occasionally tragic adventures. Tinker orbits in the world of the wealthy; Katey and Eve stretch their few dollars out each evening on the town. While all three are complex characters, Katey is the story's shining star. She is a fully realized heroine, unique in her strong sense of self amidst her life's continual fluctuations. Towles' writing also paints an inviting picture of New York City, without forgetting its sharp edges. Reminiscent of Fitzgerald, <em>Rules of Civility</em> is full of delicious sentences you can sit back and savor (most appropriately with a martini or two). <em>--Caley Anderson</em> <br><br> <b>A sophisticated and entertaining debut novel about an irresistible young woman with an uncommon sense of purpose. </b> <br><br> Set in New York City in 1938, <i>Rules of Civility</i> tells the story of a watershed year in the life of an uncompromising twenty-five-year- old named Katey Kontent. Armed with little more than a formidable intellect, a bracing wit, and her own brand of cool nerve, Katey embarks on a journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool through the upper echelons of New York society in search of a brighter future. <br><br> The story opens on New Year's Eve in a Greenwich Village jazz bar, where Katey and her boardinghouse roommate Eve happen to meet Tinker Grey, a handsome banker with royal blue eyes and a ready smile. This chance encounter and its startling consequences cast Katey off her current course, but end up providing her unexpected access to the rarified offices of Conde Nast and a glittering new social circle. Befriended in turn by a shy, principled multimillionaire, an Upper East Side ne'er-do-well, and a single-minded widow who is ahead of her times, Katey has the chance to experience first hand the poise secured by wealth and station, but also the aspirations, envy, disloyalty, and desires that reside just below the surface. Even as she waits for circumstances to bring Tinker back into her orbit, she will learn how individual choices become the means by which life crystallizes loss. <br><br> Elegant and captivating, <i>Rules of Civility</i> turns a Jamesian eye on how spur of the moment decisions define life for decades to come. A love letter to a great American city at the end of the Depression, readers will quickly fall under its spell of crisp writing, sparkling atmosphere and breathtaking revelations, as Towles evokes the ghosts of Fitzgerald, Capote, and McCarthy.<br><br> <strong>Amor Towles's <i>Rules of Civility</i> Playlist</strong> <br> <p><i>You can listen to the playlist here.</i></p> <p>While jazz is not central to the narrative of <i>Rules of Civility</i>, the music and its various formulations are an important component of the book&#x2019;s backdrop.</p> <p>On the night of January 16, 1938, Benny Goodman assembled a bi-racial orchestra to play jazz to a sold-out Carnegie Hall--the first jazz performance in the hallowed hall and one which is now famous for bringing jazz (and black performers) to a wider audience. I am not a jazz historian, but for me the concert marks something of a turning point in jazz itself--from the big-band, swing-era sound that dominated the 1930s (and which the orchestra emphasized on stage that night) towards the more introspective, smaller group styles that would soon spawn bebop and its smoky aftereffects (ultimately reaching an apogee with Miles Davis&#x2019;s <i>Kind of Blue</i> in 1957). For it is also in 1938 that Coleman Hawkins recorded the bebop antecedent "Body &amp; Soul" and Minton&#x2019;s Playhouse, one of the key bebop gathering spots, opened in Harlem. By 1939, Blue Note Records was recording, and Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk were all congregating in New York City. From 1935-1939, Goodman himself was stepping out of the big-band limelight to make more intimate improvisational recordings with a quartet including Gene Krupa and Lionel Hampton.</p> <p>My assertion of this as a turning point (like most such assertions) is rough, inexact and misleading, but it helps give shape to an evolution and bring into relief two ends of a jazz spectrum. On the big-band front, the power of the music naturally springs from the collective and orchestration. In numbers like "Sing, Sing, Sing," the carefully layered, precisely timed waning and waxing of rhythm and instrumentation towards moments of unified musical ecstasy simply demand that the audience collaborate through dance, cheers, and other outward expressions of joy. While in the smaller groups of bebop and beyond, the expressive power springs more from the soloist and his personal exploration of the music, his instrument, and his emotional state at that precise moment in time. This inevitably inspires in the listener a cigarette, a scotch, and a little more introspection. In a sense, the two ends of this jazz spectrum are like the public/private paradox of Walker Evans&#x2019;s subway photographs (and of life in the metropolis itself.)</p> <p>If you are interested, I have created an playlist of music from roughly 1935-1945 that spans this transition. The playlist is not meant to be comprehensive or exact. Among other items, it includes swinging live performances from Goodman&#x2019;s Carnegie Hall Concert as well as examples of his smaller group work; there are precursors to bebop like Coleman Hawkins and some early Charlie Parker. As a strange historical footnote, there was a strike in 1942&#x2013;1944 by the American Federation of Musicians, during which no official recordings were made. As such, this period at the onset of bebop was virtually undocumented and thus the records of 1945 reflect something of a culmination of early bebop rather than its starting point. The playlist also reflects the influence of the great American songbook giants (Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, Rodgers &amp; Hart, the Gershwins), many of whom were at the height of their powers in the 1930s. <i>--Amor Towles</i></p> <p><b>Listen to the playlist</b></p>Amor Towles has written fiction which has appeared in The Paris Review.

The power of Dr. Fiore&#39;s approach is that he recognizes the benefits of procrastination. You don&#39;t procrastinate to make yourself feel guilty or worthless or full of tension and anxiety. You procrastinate because it&#39;s actually an effective way of dealing with the pain of perfectionism and the fear of failure -- and success -- that haunt you. But though procrastination may be an effective painkiller in the short run, in the long run it produces worse pain. Overcoming Procrastination explains how to replace procrastination with better, more beneficial ways to cope with the problems that cause it. It shows you how to put a psychological safety net under yourself, one that protects you from your fear of failure and helps you bounce back from mistakes. You&#39;ll learn how to stop talking to yourself in a negative way, how to use your old, self-defeating habits to create new, positive ones, and how to transform setbacks into opportunities. One key component of the Now Habit system is the &#34;unschedule,&#34; a technique in which the only events you schedule are the fun ones -- hobbies, social dates, trips, etc. You guarantee yourself time to enjoy life. Other techniques include the &#34;reverse calendar,&#34; which enables you to create a realistic, step-by-step calendar of your path to achievement, and the &#34;flow state,&#34; which gets you into a state of focused energy, interest and concentration within two minutes or less.

Finally, after 24 years of unsuccessful effort, Robinson "escaped" to the United States via Uganda. He provides firsthand accounts of the Stalinist purges, sacrifices of World War II, and economic and political tensions of the Cold War. A rare look at Soviet life. John R. Sillito, Weber State Coll.

D., became fascinated by the paradox of the fattening of America and the brain starvation he was seeing in aging brains. His research led to this innovative conclusion: Calories you consume are bypassing your brain and being stored in fat cells. In Feed Your Brain Lose Your Belly, he reveals how ''sticky'' fat cells send mixed messages to your brain, causing you to experience persistent hunger, to overeat, and to gain weight as a result.</p> <p>If you are ready to get in touch with the signals your body generates so that you work with, not against, your innate metabolic machinery, this book is the tool you've been seeking. Weight loss will be easy as you keep hunger at bay while providing your brain with the high-octane fuel it thrives on. Feed Your Brain Lose Your Belly pairs its advice with 7 days' worth of helpful meal plans and plenty of delicious recipes.</p>  <p>Dr. McCleary's counterintuitive perspective on the benefits of brain-healthy fat consumption--supported by clinical testing with a group that called themselves the ''Biggest Losers''--will help you make critical decisions about your diet. Learning to choose foods that prevent the production of sticky fat cells rather than forcing yourself to eat less is the best way for you to feed your hungry brain cells and stay thin.</p></p><p><p></p> After graduating from Dartmouth College, Larry McCleary performed postgraduate work in theoretical physics at Boston University.

This being ankh-morpork, it&#39;s soon drawing astonished crowds, some of whom caught the zeitgeist early and arrive armed with notepads and very sensible rainwear. Moist von lipwig is not a man who enjoys hard work - as master of the post office, the mint and the royal bank his input is, of course, vital . . . But largely dependent on words, which are fortunately not very heavy and don&#39;t always need greasing. However, he does enjoy being alive, which makes a new job offer from vetinari hard to refuse . . . Steam is rising over discworld, driven by mister simnel, the man wi&#39; t&#39;flat cap and sliding rule who has an interesting arrangement with the sine and cosine. Moist will have to grapple with gallons of grease, goblins, a fat controller with a history of throwing employees down</p><p>TERRY PRATCHETT is the acclaimed creator of the global bestselling Discworld series, the first of which, <i>The Colour of Magic,</i> was published in 1983. <i>Raising Steam</i> is his fortieth Discworld novel. His books have been widely adapted for stage and screen, and he is the winner of multiple prizes, including the Carnegie Medal, as well as being awarded a knighthood for services to literature. After falling out with his keyboard he now talks to his computer. Occasionally, these days, it answers back.It is hard to understand nothing, but the multiverse is full of it. Nothing travels everywhere, always ahead of something, and in the great cloud of unknowing nothing yearns to become something, to break out, to move, to feel, to change, to dance and to experience&#x2014;in short, to be something.<br><br>And now it found its chance as it drifted in the ether. Nothing, of course, knew about something, but this something was different, oh yes, and so nothing slid silently into something and floated down with everything in mind and, fortunately, landed on the back of a turtle, a very large one, and hurried to become something even faster. It was elemental and nothing was better than that and suddenly the elemental was captured! The bait had worked.<br><br>Anyone who has ever seen the River Ankh sliding along its bed of miscellaneous nastiness would understand why so much of the piscine food for the people of Ankh-Morpork has to be supplied by the fishing fleets of Quirm. In order to prevent terrible gastric trouble for the citizenry, Ankh-Morpork fishmongers have to ensure that their suppliers make their catches a long, long way from the city.<br><br>For Bowden Jeffries, purveyor of the very best in seafood, the two hundred miles or more which lay between the fish docks at Quirm and the customers in Ankh-Morpork was a regrettably long distance throughout the winter, autumn, and spring and a sheer penance in the summertime, because the highway, such as it was, became a linear furnace all the way to the Big City. Once you had had to deal with a ton of overheated octopus, you never forgot it; the smell lasted for days, and followed you around and almost into your bedroom. You could never get it out of your clothes. <br><br>People were so demanding, but the elite of Ankh-Morpork and, indeed, everyone else wanted their fish, even in the hottest part of the season. Even with an icehouse built by his own two hands and, by arrangement, a second icehouse halfway along the journey, it made you want to cry, it really did. <br><br>And he said as much to his cousin, Relief Jeffries, a market gardener, who looked at his beer and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always the same. Nobody wants to help the small entrepreneur. Can you imagine how quickly strawberries turn into little balls of mush in the heat? Well, I&#x2019;ll tell you: no time at all. Blink and you miss &#x2019;em, just when everybody wants their strawberries. And you ask the watercress people how difficult it is to get the damn stuff to the city before it&#x2019;s as limp as a second-day sermon. We should petition the government!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said his cousin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had enough of this. Let&#x2019;s write to the newspapers! That&#x2019;s the way to get things done. Everyone&#x2019;s complaining about the fruit and vegetables and the seafood. Vetinari should be made to understand the plight of the small-time entrepreneur. After all, what do we occasionally pay our taxes for?&#x201d;<br><br>Dick Simnel was ten years old when, back at the family smithy in Sheepridge, his father simply disappeared in a cloud of furnace parts and flying metal, all enveloped in a pink steam. He was never found in the terrible haze of scorching dampness, but on that very day young Dick Simnel vowed to whatever was left of his father in that boiling steam that he would make steam his servant. <br><br>His mother had other ideas. She was a midwife, and as she said to her neighbors, &#x201c;Babbies are born everywhere. I&#x2019;ll never be without a customer.&#x201d; So, against her son&#x2019;s wishes, Elsie Simnel decided to take him away from what she now considered to be a haunted place. She packed up their belongings and together they returned to her family home near Sto Lat, where people didn&#x2019;t inexplicably disappear in a hot pink cloud. <br><br>Soon after they arrived something important happened to her boy. One day while waiting for his mother to return from a difficult delivery, Dick walked into a building that looked interesting, and which turned out to be a library. At first he thought it was full of poncy stuff, all kings and poets and lovers and battles, but in one crucial book he found something called mathematics and the world of numbers. <br><br>And that was why, one day some ten years later, he pulled together every fibre of his being and said, &#x201c;Mother, you know last year when I said I were going &#x2019;iking in the mountains of Uberwald with me mates, well, it were kind of . . . sort of . . . a kind of lie, only very small, mind you.&#x201d; Dick blushed. &#x201c;You see, I found t&#x2019;keys to Dad&#x2019;s old shed and, well, I went back to Sheepridge and did some experimenting and&#x201d;&#x2014;he looked at his mother anxiously &#x201c;&#x2014;I think I know what &#x2019;e were doing wrong.&#x201d; <br><br>Dick was braced for stiff objections, but he hadn&#x2019;t reckoned on tears&#x2014;so many tears&#x2014;and as he tried to console her he added, &#x201c;You, Mother, and Uncle Flavius got me an education, you got me the knowing of the numbers, including the arithmetic and weird stuff dreamed up by the philosophers in Ephebe where even camels can do logarithms on their toes. Dad didn&#x2019;t know this stuff. He had the right ideas but he didn&#x2019;t have the . . . tech-nol-ogy right.&#x201d; <br><br>At this point, Dick allowed his mother to talk, and she said, &#x201c;I know there&#x2019;s no stopping you, our Dick, you&#x2019;re just like your stubborn father were, pigheaded. Is that what you&#x2019;ve been doin&#x2019; in the barn? Teck-ology?&#x201d; She looked at him accusingly, then sighed. &#x201c;I can see I can&#x2019;t tell you what to do, but you tell me: how can your &#x2018;logger-reasons&#x2019; stop you goin&#x2019; the way of your poor old dad?&#x201d; She started sobbing again. <br><br>Dick pulled out of his jacket something that looked like a small wand, which might have been made for a miniature wizard, and said, &#x201c;This&#x2019;ll keep me safe, Mother! I&#x2019;ve the knowing of the sliding rule! I can tell the sine what to do, and the cosine likewise and work out the tangent of t&#x2019;quaderatics! Come on, Mother, stop fretting and come wi&#x2019; me now to t&#x2019;barn. You must see &#x2019;er!&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Simnel, reluctant, was dragged by her son to the great open barn he had kitted out like the workshop back at Sheepridge, hoping against hope that her son had accidentally found himself a girl. Inside the barn she looked helplessly at a large circle of metal which covered most of the floor. Something metallic whizzed round and round on the metal, sounding like a squirrel in a cage, giving off a smell much like camphor. <br><br>&#x201c;Here she is, Mother. Ain&#x2019;t she champion?&#x201d; Dick said happily. &#x201c;I call her Iron Girder!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But what is it, son?&#x201d;<br><br>He grinned hugely and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s what they call a pro-to-type, Mother. You&#x2019;ve got to &#x2019;ave a pro-to-type if you&#x2019;re going to be an engineer.&#x201d;<br><br>His mother smiled wanly but there was no stopping Dick. The words just tumbled out.<br><br>&#x201c;The thing is, Mother, before you attempt owt you&#x2019;ve got to &#x2019;ave some idea of what it is you want to do. One of the books I found in the library was about being an architect. And in that book, the man who wrote it said before he built his next big &#x2019;ouse he always made quite tiny models to get an idea of how it would all work out. He said it sounds fiddly and stuff, but going slowly and being thorough is the only way forward. And so I&#x2019;m testing &#x2019;er out slowly, seeing what works and what doesn&#x2019;t. And actually, I&#x2019;m quite proud of me&#x2019;sen. In the beginning I made t&#x2019;track wooden, but I reckoned that the engine I wanted would be very &#x2019;eavy, so I chopped up t&#x2019;wooden circle for firewood and went back to t&#x2019;forge.&#x201d; <br><br>Mrs. Simnel looked at the little mechanism running round and round on the barn floor and said, in the voice of someone really trying to understand, &#x201c;Eee, lad, but what does it do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I remembered what Dad said about t&#x2019;time he were watching t&#x2019;kettle boiling and noticed t&#x2019;lid going up and down with the pressure, and he told me that one day someone would build a bigger kettle that would lift more than a kettle lid. And I believe I have the knowing of the way to build a proper kettle, Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what good would that do, my boy?&#x201d; said his mother sternly. And she watched the glow in her son&#x2019;s eyes as he said, &#x201c;Everything, Mother. Everything.&#x201d;<br><br>Still in a haze of slight misunderstanding, Mrs. Simnel watched him unroll a large and rather grubby piece of paper.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s called a blueprint, Mother. You&#x2019;ve got to have a blueprint. It shows you how everything fits together.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Is this part of the pro-to-type?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy looked at his doting mother&#x2019;s face and realized that a little more exposition should be forthcoming. He took her by the hand and said, &#x201c;Mother, I know they&#x2019;re all lines and circles to you, but once you have the knowing of the circles and the lines and all, you know that this is a picture of an engine.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Simnel gripped his hand and said, &#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re going to do with it, our Dick?&#x201d; <br><br>And young Simnel grinned and said happily, &#x201c;Change things as needs changing, Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Simnel gave her son a curious look for a moment or two, then appeared to reach a grudging conclusion and said, &#x201c;Just you come with me, my lad.&#x201d; <br><br>She led him back into the house, where they climbed up the ladder into the attic. She pointed out to her son a sturdy seaman&#x2019;s chest covered in dust. <br><br>&#x201c;Your granddad gave me this to give to you, when I thought you needed it. Here&#x2019;s the key.&#x201d;<br><br>She was gratified that he didn&#x2019;t grab it and indeed looked carefully at the trunk before opening it. As he pushed up the lid, suddenly the air was filled with the glimmer of gold.<br><br>&#x201c;Your granddad were slightly a bit of a pirate and then he got religion and were a bit afeared, and the last words he said to me on his deathbed were, &#x2018;That young lad&#x2019;ll do something one day, you mark my words, our Elsie, but I&#x2019;m damned if I know what it&#x2019;s going to be.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>The people of the town were quite accustomed to the clangings and bangings emanating every day from the various blacksmith forges for which the area was famous. It seemed that, even though he had set up a forge of his own, young Simnel had decided not to enter the blacksmithing trade, possibly due to the dreadful business of Mr. Simnel Senior&#x2019;s leaving the world so abruptly. The local blacksmiths soon got used to making mysterious items that young Mr. Simnel had sketched out meticulously. He never told them what he was constructing, but since they were earning a lot of money they didn&#x2019;t mind.<br><br>The news of his legacy got around, of course&#x2014;gold always finds its way out somehow&#x2014;and there was a scratching of heads among the population exemplified by the oldest inhabitant, who, sitting on the bench outside the tavern, said, &#x201c;Well, bugger me! Lad were blessed wi&#x2019; an inherited fortune in gold and turned it into a load of old iron!&#x201d;<br><br>He laughed, and so did everybody else, but nevertheless they continued to watch young Dick Simnel slip in and out of the wicket gate of his old and almost derelict barn, double-padlocked at all times. <br><br>Simnel had found a couple of local likely lads who helped him make things and move things around. Over time, the barn was augmented by a host of other sheds. More lads were taken on and the hammers were heard all day every day and, a bit at a time, information trickled into what might be called the local consciousness.<br><br>Apparently the lad had made a pump, an interesting pump that pumped water very high. And then he&#x2019;d thrown everything away and said things like, &#x201c;We need more steel than iron.&#x201d; <br><br>There were tales of great reams of paper laid out on desks as young Simnel worked out a wonderful &#x201c;undertaking,&#x201d; as he called it. Admittedly there had been the occasional explosion, and then people heard about what the lads called &#x201c;the Bunker,&#x201d; which had been useful to jump into on several occasions when there had been a little . . . incident. And then there was the unfamiliar but somehow homely and rhythmic &#x201c;chuffing&#x201d; noise. Really quite a pleasant noise, almost hypnotic, which was strange because the mechanical creature that was making the noise sounded more alive than you would have expected.<br><br>It was noticed in the locality that the two main coworkers of Mr. Simnel, or &#x201c;Mad Iron&#x201d; Simnel as some were now calling him, seemed somewhat changed, more grown-up and aware of themselves; young men, acolytes of the mysterious thing behind the doors. And no amount of bribery by beer or by women in the pub would make them give up the precious secrets of the barn. They conducted themselves now as befitted the masters of the fiery furnace. <br><br>And then, of course, there were the sunny days when young Simnel and his cohorts dug long lines in the field next to the barn and filled them with metal while the furnace glowed day and night and everyone shook their heads and said, &#x201c;Madness.&#x201d; And this went on, it seemed forever, until ever was finished and the banging and clanging and smelting had stopped. Then Mr. Simnel&#x2019;s lieutenants pulled aside the double doors of the big barn and filled the world with smoke.<br><br>Very little happened in this part of Sto Lat and this was enough to bring people running. Most of them arrived in time to see something heading out toward them, panting and steaming, with fast-spinning wheels and oscillating rods eerily appearing and disappearing in the smoke and the haze, and on top of it all, like a sort of king of smoke and fire, Dick Simnel, his face contorted with the effort of concentration. It was faintly reassuring that this something was apparently under the control of somebody human&#x2014;although the more thoughtful of the onlookers might have added &#x201c;So what? So&#x2019;s a spoon,&#x201d; and got ready to run away as the steaming, dancing, spinning, reciprocating engine cleared the barn and plunged on down the tracks laid in the field. And the bystanders, most of whom were now byrunners, and in certain instances bystampeders, fled and complained, except, of course, for every little boy of any age who followed it with eyes open wide, vowing there and then that one day he would be the captain of the terrible noxious engine, oh yes indeed. A prince of the steam! A master of the sparks! A coachman of the Thunderbolts!</p><h2>Men and the Water of Life: Initiation and the Tempering of Men</h2><p>Presents a collection of stories that is a multigenerational exploration of what it means to be a man, including tales of ritual mating dances and life in the African bush</p><p>A multicultural mythologist marks a vital new phase in contemporary men's work by telling personally moving, universally evocative tales--from the mythic mating dance of an adolescent's Saturday night to a <i>Forest of Stories</i> from the African bush, ancient Ireland, Germany, Japan, and Russia.In an effort to balance all the self-actualization books aimed at women, Meade successfully compiles international legends and myths that allow men to examine themselves objectively. This, Meade hopes, will help us avoid the chaos and ruin that occurs when a society no longer contains a relevant mythology, much as Joseph Campbell observed. The book is most effective in its use of ancient stories to illuminate conflicts modern men may experience. For instance, one story tells of a boy and a half-giantess who brews all the elements of creation in her cauldron. The boy steals food from her, symbolizing the partaking of wisdom, which helps him to become a full-fledged adult. Through such tales, the author examines how men can learn to understand their inner landscapes.

In these pages, an exuberant crew is summoned to create a snowman of heroic proportions. Starting with the very first flake, Alice Schertle's clever and energetic rhyming text details the steps these little sculptors take to create a chilly chum. Barbara Lavallee's bold and lively illustrations overflow with brisk winter energy.<br> Snow, colorful clothes, and a dash of the miraculous combine to shape a winter experience that is both familiar and fantastic. <br></p><p><b>ALICE SCHERTLE</b> is a well-known poet with many picture books to her credit, including<i> William and Grandpa,</i> which won the Christopher Award<i>. </i>She lives in the Berkshires of Massachusetts.<br><br><b>BARBARA LAVALLEE</b> is best known for illustrating <i>Mama, Do You Love Me?,</i> which won a Golden Kite Award. She lives in Anchorage, Alaska. <br>While this deceptively simple book starring children building a snowman is ultimately about community-how human beings, no matter how small, can help each other create something bigger than themselves-youngsters will find the lilting language and action-filled illustrations to be just plain fun. Schertle's (How Now, Brown Cow?) text deftly describes what goes into making a snowman: "Billions of snowflakes/ piled in a mound,/ pat them/ and pack them/ and roll them/ around/ into one big ball." Her refrain-"That's all you need for a snowman. Except..."-encourages readers to turn the page for each new component. The watercolors, meanwhile, feature children in padded winter jackets who work together. As in childhood, the snowman looms larger than life. As they roll that "one big ball," for example, the children appear to be hugging the edge of a snow-white planet. They place saucer-size bottle caps on the snowman's face-"Surprise!/ Snowman's eyes!"-and add a broom taller than a house. The completed snowman is so huge that the book needs to be turned sideways to view it. Lavallee's illustrations, in the style of her work in Mama, Do You Love Me?, emphasize the children's profiles, shadowing one half of each face as if each character possessed both light and dark skin.

Le Guin ( Searoad: The Chronicles of Klatsand , HarperCollins, 1991) is as expert in creating mellifluous and enchanting essays as she is in creating the luscious and complex worlds of her fiction. Stylistically, she manages a balance between quasi-academic seriousness and conversational humor (a balance that original editor Susan Wood does not attain in her introductions). Despite being three to 13 years out of date, depending on the extent of revision, her comments on the state of the genre, the process of writing, and the influence of gender on literature are as fresh as ever. The book is dated only in its ratio of female to male writers of fantasy and sf, which is now closer than it was when Le Guin first wrote. Highly recommended for all literature and women's studies collections.<br><i>- Keith R.A. DeCan dido, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.For Le Guin, writing science fiction or fantasy is an intuitive, self-exploratory act, an inner-space voyage in which she unearths dreams and archetypes that connect her with the outer world. In these conversational, feisty essays, an energizing mind trip for SF fans, she dissects her own fiction, discusses technique and explores the potential of SF and fantasy, which she considers different branches of the same form of writing. Most SF has been regressive and unimaginative, she argues, by portraying authoritarian dystopias instead of democratic socialist societies. She also berates the genre for its marginalization of women, both as fictional characters and as writers. This is essentially a reissue of a 1979 compilation that went out of print in 1982. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Marketing Outrageously: How to Increase Your Revenue by Staggering Amounts!</h2><p>Jon Spoelstra, one of the country&#39;s best sports marketers, contends there is less risk and more payoffs in creating outrageous marketing.</p><p>Too Much Revenue?<br>Have you ever known a company to be in trouble because of too much money coming in?

How much should an executor suppress? Does the public's right to know override an individual's right to privacy?<br>To answer these questions, Ian Hamilton presents a probing and far-reaching account of literary estate management and mismanagement through the centuries from Donne and Shakespeare to Plath and Larkin. In a gripping series of case studies, he recounts the battles between the protective and the curious, between the keepers of the sacred flame and those who might seek to snuff it out.<br>Hamilton offers a violent, lurid and hugely entertaining history of broken promises and mismanaged wills, of reputations whitewashed or maligned, of scholars and crooks, of muddle, trickery, scandal and vendetta. He includes the burning of Byron's memoir, the deification of Shelley and Henry James' attempt to "fix" his own posthumous reputation as well as the more recent controversies surrounding the Plath and Larkin estates. Throughout, Hamilton presents an array of well-meaning acolytes - admirers, best friends, widows - whose task it was to keep the flame sacred.<br>Offering a compelling contribution to current debate on the moral issues of biography, Hamilton writes of the "greats" of English literature with an intimacy and a subversive wit that make this book a joy to read.</p><p>Ian Hamilton was born in 1938, in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and educated at Darlington Grammar School and Keble College, Oxford. In 1962, he founded the influential poetry magazine, the <i>Review</i>, and he was later editor of the <i>New Review</i>. He also wrote biographies and journalism, mainly about literature and football. He died in 2001.A surprisingly original study of the literary estates of many famed writers, and a look at the tangled relationship between estate management and biography. Hamilton wrote the strong Robert Lowell (1982) and the admirable In Search of J.D. Salinger (1988). Estates that Hamilton looks into include those of John Donne the Younger, Shakespeare, Marvell, Milton, Pope, Boswell, Robert Burns, Byron, Dickens, Tennyson, Swinburne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Henry James, Hardy, Kipling, Joyce, Eliot, and Sylvia Plath. John Donne made no mention of his poems in his will and, thinking them a young man's ``evaporations'' and ``vanities,'' would have preferred that these sins be destroyed. Following his death, Shakespeare's plays were edited by two fellow actors and ``set forth according to their first originals,'' as these friends put it, saving eighteen of Shakespeare's plays from oblivion (including King Lear, The Tempest, and Macbeth) and several others, according to Hamilton, from being handed down in ``irretrievably corrupt'' texts. While poets' posthumous papers gave rise to biography, Dr. Johnson wrote his hasty Lives of the Poets to consolidate publishers' copyrights on various posthumous materials. Meanwhile, Boswell took down Johnson's table talk for his monumental Life of Johnson (Macauley later damned Boswell as a drunkard, pipsqueak, and lickspittle), then left a hoard of journals and Boswelliana that engendered the great Boswell papers saga. Hamilton follows the styles of biography as one mode rises over the body of earlier modes: the Victorian biography, for instance, reflects the newly emerging Romantic concept of the artist. Dickens writes long letters to his future ``beeograffer,'' John Forster. Joyce appoints his benefactress Harriet Shaw Weaver as his literary executor; she also inherits his mad daughter. Eliot directed that there should be ``no biographies,'' and his estate will not go public until 2015. Ted Hughes' trial-by-gravestone bequeathed him by Sylvia Plath is quite moving. As a commentary on literary mortality, and on biography and trumpery, this is book is a treasure. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There have been many biographies of Stanley, but Jeal's is the most felicitous, the best informed, the most complete and readable and exhaustive, profiting from his access to an immense new trove of Stanley material." -- <b>Paul Theroux, front page, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b>&nbsp;<b></b><p>Henry Morton Stanley, so the tale goes, was a cruel imperialist who connived with King Leopold II of Belgium in horrific crimes against the people of the Congo. He also conducted the most legendary celebrity interview in history, opening with, Dr. Livingstone, I presume?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But these perceptions are not quite true, Tim Jeal shows in this grand and colorful biography. With unprecedented access to previously closed Stanley family archives, Jeal reveals the amazing extent to which Stanley&#x2019;s public career and intimate life have been misunderstood and undervalued. Jeal recovers the reality of Stanley&#x2019;s life a life of almost impossible extremes in this moving story of tragedy, adventure, disappointment, and success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Few have started life as disadvantaged as Stanley. Rejected by both parents and consigned to a Welsh workhouse, he emigrated to America as a penniless eighteen-year-old. Jeal vividly re-creates Stanley&#x2019;s rise to success, his friendships and romantic relationships, and his&nbsp; life-changing decision to assume an American identity. Stanley&#x2019;s epic but&nbsp; unfairly forgotten African journeys are thrillingly described, establishing&nbsp; the explorer as the greatest to set foot on the continent. Few biographies can claim so thoroughly to reappraise a reputation; few portray a more extraordinary historical figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Tim Jeal </b>is also the biographer of Henry Morton Stanley (National Book Critics' Circle Award in Biography and Sunday Times Biography of the Year 2007), and Robert Baden-Powell, which (like Livingstone) was chosen as a Notable Book of the Year by the New York Times and the Washington Post. In 2011 his Explorers of the Nile was a New York Times Editor's Choice and a BBC Radio 4 Book of the Week.<br><p>Reviewed by Jason Roberts</p><p>It's hard to imagine a more intriguing -- and intimidating -- challenge to the biographer's art than the life of journalist, explorer and continental opportunist Sir Henry Morton Stanley (1841-1904). He is rare among celebrities of centuries past, in that the years have not transmuted his fame into benign augustness nor obscurity, but rather into infamy: Post-Victorian sensibilities have long since extinguished the heroic light once cast upon Stanley's expeditions into so-called "darkest Africa." The man who did more than any other Westerner to illuminate what Joseph Conrad termed "the unsolved mystery of that continent" is now less commemorated for his achievements than condemned for the ruthlessness by which he achieved them.</p><p>Even during his lifetime, exploits that once thrilled admirers began to appall. Stanley wrote casually of beating his native porters to perk up "the physical energy of the lazily inclined." He once observed that the massacre of 33 Bumbireh warriors should teach the survivors to "in future behave with some regard to the rights of strangers." Yet as Tim Jeal points out in this commanding, definitive biography, much of this was bluster, calculated to fit the public-consumption ideal of the Great White Conqueror.</p><p>The unguarded Stanley was remarkably minimal in his racism, declaring himself "prepared to admit any black man possessing the attributes of true manhood, or any good qualities, to my friendship, even to a brotherhood with myself." The violence he perpetrated was regularly exaggerated, usually by Stanley himself. It's not hard to find evidence of similarly inexcusable behavior among his contemporary explorers -- even the Scottish missionary David Livingstone, whom Stanley famously set out to "rescue" from the African interior, not only killed several natives but punitively burned their huts. None of this serves as an apology for the man, but it demonstrates that is impossible to view Henry Morton Stanley plain. One must filter his image through two distorting prisms, that of his era and of our own.</p><p>The overarching challenge of Stanley's biographers has always been one of sorting through the subject's self-perpetuated bits of legendry, glosses on the truth and outright lies, and here Jeal takes an already-fascinating story to new levels. It's long been known that "Henry Morton Stanley" began life as John Rowlands, the illegitimate and abandoned child of a teenage mother in Wales; after years of suppressing that fact, Stanley explained that, wanting to escape both "the stains [of] ugly poverty" and "the odium attached to the old name and its dolorous history," he'd made his way to New Orleans, where he'd been propitiously adopted by the cotton broker Henry Hope Stanley. But Jeal puts forth, for the first time, convincing evidence that this was an utter fabrication. It's likely that Stanley never even met the wealthy merchant whose name he appropriated.</p><p>Profoundly rootless in Civil War-era America, the young man drifted through both the Confederate and Union armies, then through the U.S. Navy (which he deserted for the goldfields of Colorado) before seeking glory overseas. He launched an ill-starred expedition to Asia Minor -- in reality, a jaunt on a fruit boat from Boston to Smyrna, which promptly degraded into chaos, claims of horse thievery and a stint in a Turkish prison. But the persona of Stanley the adventurer was born. He was 26 in 1867, when he convinced the New York Herald to underwrite the publicity stunt of tracking Livingstone (who was not lost, just rarely able to communicate with the outside world) to the shores of Lake Tanganyika.</p><p>Stunt though it was, the trek and two subsequent expeditions proved supreme tests of will. Stanley emerged from Africa 18 years later "like a man of seventy-five: gaunt, hollow-eyed and grim," haunted by the deaths of the vast majority of his traveling companions, famous but constantly in fear of being exposed as the self-creation he was -- or worse yet, as the cast-off, low-caste boy he had been.</p><p>Jeal's biography is an unalloyed triumph, not only because it is painstakingly researched and eminently readable, but because it never loses sight of the abandoned child in the man, driving him forward, "able to frighten, able to suffer, but also able to command love and obedience." Such a personality, Jeal notes, is "an extinct species, and all the more remarkable for that." </p><p> </p><p><br>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

But as Patrick McGilligan states in his fine introduction, those days were quite different from the ones that followed. The whole craft of the screenplay didn't develop until the end of the silent era, and after it had developed, writers tended to be isolated from one another. Screenwriting was seen as hack work, something a legitimate playwright, novelist, or even a journalist did to raise money. <i>Backstory 1</i> features interviews with 15 of the finest Hollywood scenarists from the 1920s and '30s, including Charles Burnett, James M. Cain, Lenore Coffee, Philip Dunne, Julius J. Epstein, Albert Hackett, Norman Krasna, Richard Maibaum, Casey Robinson, and Donald Ogden Stewart. These writers may not be familiar, but their movies surely are. This anthology of interviews is invaluable for its insights into a budding craft and into artists whose work has been obscured by critics and audiences who preferred to propel actors, directors, and producers into stardom.Hollywood reminiscences are apparently as limitless as they are irresistible to film buffs. Backstoryan old screenwriting term for the story that has taken place before the action of a movie beginsgives veteran screenwriters their turn in this collection of 14 interviews.It has the usual quota of who-said-what-to-whom anecdotes, but with less than their usual amusement value. Among the interviews, some of which have been previously published, only three were conducted by McGilligan, a contributing editor to American Film. Long the victims of notorious mistreatment by the studios and now well advanced in years (several have died since these interviews took place), the writers here can be forgiven the impulse to have the last word and settle accounts, but the frequent squabbling over screen credits and insistence on their own importance gives this collection an aggrieved, sometimes crabby, tone. There are plesant memories and bright patches (Julius Epstein, Donald Ogden Stewart), valuable comments on the art of screenwriting and occasionally some interesting gossip (director Frank Capra had a painting of Mussolini on his bedroom wall; WW II Secret Service/FBI meetings were held in Cecil B. DeMille's office), but overall the interviews confirm the cliche that old Hollywood was a bad place for writers, leaving them well-paid but frustrated, cynical, or wistfully disappointed. Photos.

Swapping his job as proprietor of an Australian stud farm to work undercover as a stable hand in Yorkshire, Danny soon has his hands full. Whilst the Earl&#39;s attractive daughters Patricia and Elinor draw his attention, he finds himself ever more deeply involved with the vicious swindlers he is out to entrap. And if neither the money nor the swindle will keep his mind on the job, maybe the death of the Earl&#39;s original investigator, Tommy Stapleton, will...</p><p>This first collection of short stories by Dick Francis (author of <i>10 Lb. Penalty</i> and more than 30 other horseracing mysteries) pulls together five new tales with eight that have appeared scattered in periodicals over the last three decades. One of the pleasures of his stories is witnessing the breadth and variety within Francis's racetrack milieu. In "Dead on Red," a jealous jockey named Davey Rockman hires Emil Jacques, a French assassin and gun collector, to kill the famed rider who stole his job; but Rockman is haunted by his deed much in the same way as is the protagonist in Edgar Allan Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart." "Raid at Kingdom Hill" tells of Tricksy Wilcox's scheme for a not-so-bright bomb scare, a plan that still might yield the payoff of a lifetime. "Collision Course" is free of murder but frames a delightful conflict between an out-of-work newspaperman and a bounder whose faux manners threaten to bring him down at the peak of his racing syndicate career. The Kentucky Derby story, "The Gift," follows Fred Collyer, a drunken writer who overhears plans for a major racing swindle and struggles against alcohol to publish the story by his deadline. And the collection ends with a what-if story called "Haig's Death" that examines the consequences of the sudden passing of Christopher Haig, an animal feed consultant and race-meeting judge.<p> Poe, who most historians of literature credit as the creator of the short story, declared that a good short story should have nothing extraneous. Francis's stories, for the most part, obey Poe's dictum. Each character and description fits tightly into an unfolding plan so that the mystery or twist is revealed with a satisfying economy of words. While <i>Field of 13</i> will appeal to Francis loyalists, newcomers, too, will find much to relish in the short fiction of this mystery grand master. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>Dick Francis (pictured with his son Felix Francis) was born in South Wales in 1920.

At sixteen, he was left to fend for himself while his father fled with the rest of the family to Moscow, escaping&nbsp;debtors&#x2019; prison. After finishing school in his native town, Chekhov went to Moscow, where, with the aid of a scholarship, he entered the University to study medicine. To help with the family finances, he started publishing tales, anecdotes, jokes, and articles. By the time he took his medical degree in 1884, writing had become his main interest and occupation. His literary reputation grew with the publication of the book <i>Motley Stories</i> (1886). That same year, he made the acquaintance of Alexei Suvorin, owner of the newspaper <i>New Time</i>, who invited him to contribute longer tales at a higher rate. In 1888, he was awarded the Pushkin Prize for the collection <i>In the Twilight</i>. This and the publication of the long story <i>The Steppe</i> marked the beginning of Chekhov&#x2019;s recognition as one of Russia&#x2019;s leading writers. In the years following, he produced his first serious full-length play, <i>Ivanov </i>(1887), as well as a steady stream of short stories. The first production of his famous play <i>The Sea Gull</i> (1896) was a miserable failure. But in 1898, the play was revived at the Moscow Art Theater and proved a resounding success, as did the Theater&#x2019;s productions of <i>The Three Sisters</i> and <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. In 1901, he married the actress Olga Knipper. He died of tuberculosis.<br>&nbsp;<br>Born in New York City in 1927, <b>Robert Brustein</b> is one of the country&#x2019;s preeminent drama critics.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Dozois's Year's Best, like any successful representative of a large constituency, sometimes suffers from blandness and inconsistency. As usual, it's oversized?23 stories, nearly 600 pages?and includes a variety of types of SF as well as near-horror, fantasy and humor. Five of the stories are final nominees for Nebulas, and two new "Hainish" stories by Ursula LeGuin were nominated for Tiptree Awards; "The Matter of Segrri" won. No story here is less than competent and professional; but, with a few exceptions, there is a voiceless sameness in the writing, practically a house style, that over so many pages grows tedious. (Nearly half the stories, by page count, come from the Dozois-edited Asimov's Science Fiction.) A number are flawed ("hard" SF stories about "aliens" that think just like humans) or unremarkable, but these are outweighed by many fine pieces and by standouts such as LeGuin's "Forgiveness Day," perhaps the best story in the book; Eliot Fintushel's "New Wave"-like "Ylem"; William Sanders's "Going After Old Man Alabama" and Terry Bisson's "The Hole in the Hole," both of which are winning and funny; Katherine Kerr's chilling "Asylum"; and Michael Bishop's grand and humane "Cri de Coeur." Dozois's intelligently and ably put-together anthology does its stated job as well as any one book or editor could.

But some genes spread in spite of being harmful to the host organism&#x2014;by distorting their own transmission to the next generation, or by changing how the host behaves toward relatives. As a consequence, different genes in a single organism can have diametrically opposed interests and adaptations. </p><p> Covering all species from yeast to humans, <i>Genes in Conflict</i> is the first book to tell the story of selfish genetic elements, those continually appearing stretches of DNA that act narrowly to advance their own replication at the expense of the larger organism. As Austin Burt and Robert Trivers show, these selfish genes are a universal feature of life with pervasive effects, including numerous counter-adaptations. Their spread has created a whole world of socio-genetic interactions within individuals, usually completely hidden from sight. </p><p> <i>Genes in Conflict</i> introduces the subject of selfish genetic elements in all its aspects, from molecular and genetic to behavioral and evolutionary. Burt and Trivers give us access for the first time to a crucial area of research&#x2014;now developing at an explosive rate&#x2014;that is cohering as a unitary whole, with its own logic and interconnected questions, a subject certain to be of enduring importance to our understanding of genetics and evolution. </p></p><p><b>Austin Burt</b> is Professor of Evolutionary Genetics, Imperial College London.Robert Trivers is an under-appreciated genius, and one of history's greatest thinkers in the analysis of behavior and emotion.<br> --Steven Pinker, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Blank Slate and How the Mind Works.</i><br><br>Most of us have met at least one person who stands out as the epitome of logical thinking, someone you can trust to see the flaws in any erroneous conclusion and resolve the needle of signal in a haystack of seemly discordant data. Austin Burt is that person for me, and his new book on genetic conflict reflects this intellectual prowess.<br> --Bill Rice<br><br><i>Genes in Conflict</i> is a well-written and beautifully organized synthesis that forges a link between evolutionary and molecular biology. It should be read by evolutionary biologists wishing to learn more about the menagerie of selfish genetic elements and by molecular biologists wishing to gain some evolutionary insights into their particular systems.<br> --David Haig<br><br>Just over ten years ago, Trivers joined forces with geneticist Austin Burt for a detailed study of selfish genetic elements, and <i>Genes in Conflict</i> is the result of their fruitful collaboration. The book is the first of its kind and admirably fills an empty niche.<br> --James F. Crow (<i>Nature</i> 2006-03-30)<br><br><i>Genes in Conflict</i>, by evolutionary geneticist Austin Burt and biologist Robert Trivers, is the first book to review the vast empirical literature on selfish genetic elements. It reveals how widespread these elements are in nature, what evolutionary effects they have had on fundamental aspects of the genetic system itself (such as its size, organization, and degree of recombination), and how they influence reproduction, development, and behavior. While enthusiastically addressing the ever-accelerating advance of genetic conflict studies, the authors also take care to identify many open questions. Their fascinating and comprehensive book provides a gold mine for anyone entering the field.<br> --Peter Hammerstein and Edward H. Hagen (<i>Science</i> 2006-04-28)<br><br><i> Genes in Conflict</i> is an important contribution to biology and to the humanities: for biology, because it collects and represents a comprehensive source of information on the developing understanding of selfish Code; for the humanities, because it forces a reconceptualization of what all of "life" is, and then perhaps, what it might become.<br> --Nicholas Ruiz III (<i>Metapsychology</i>)<br><br><i>Genes in Conflict</i> is the first book to review all aspects of this topic in depth...At just over 600 pages, it is a weighty and impressive work, and will undoubtedly serve as the major source of reference for years to come...Few, if any, biologists have expert knowledge on all of these fields, and many of the facts that they describe were unknown to me. I have certainly learnt a lot about systems of which I was ignorant or only dimly aware. For the topics where I do know something, the level of accuracy is very high...<i>Genes in Conflict</i> is an outstanding contribution to the literature on evolution, and can be read profitably by all kinds of biologists. <br> --Brian Charlesworth (<i>Current Biology</i>)<br><br>Burt and Trivers offer a comprehensive, extensively referenced description of selfish genetic elements in eukaryotes. The book begins with a summary of these elements, followed in subsequent chapters by in-depth descriptions of specific classes of selfish DNA...In addition to providing a detailed description of various forms of selfish DNA, the book discusses a number of interesting topics relating to these genetic elements...Faculty would find many of these topics a useful springboard for discussions in genetics and other classes.<br> --P. Guilfoile (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>Thought provoking...In their 602-page opus, Burt and Trivers provide a plethora of exciting case studies. Although there is no lack of data to discuss, the authors emphasize repeatedly how little we really know about this area of evolution and biodiversity. I found the tone of this book to be very engaging. It is full of details that have been woven together into a very readable, well-organized package. Of importance for the nonspecialist reader, Burt and Trivers succeed in conveying complex concepts in population genetics without using mathematical equations...What a gift to graduate students and all researchers who are just entering this field of evolutionary biology! I found at least a dozen good projects for Ph.D. theses suggested within the pages of this book, and I am sure that there are many more.<br> --Fred Gould (<i>American Scientist</i> 2006-11-01)<br><br>Some genes take advantage of the environment created by the cooperation of most of the others to advance their own rate of transmission. With their book <i>Genes in Conflict</i>, Burt and Trivers bring to the forefront this intragenomic treachery revealing that genetic incompatibilities are diverse in form, widespread in nature, and perhaps most provoking is that these conflicts have significantly influenced the evolution of genomes, populations, and species. To this end they have synthesized a huge body of literature with the goal of understanding all aspects of genetic conflict in eukaryotic genomes without ignoring any fact of biology where studies have been done. Much of this literature had lacked previous review...In each chapter Burt and Trivers are careful to demarcate the numerous questions awaiting answer, ending the book with a summary of future directions, as well as a provocative list of host features that they propose have arisen as the result of genetic conflict...This book is an incredible resource for any scientist interested in evolutionary genetics. Burt and Trivers have tackled a huge breadth of topics without sacrificing depth. They are able to compare sometimes seemingly disparate phenomena suggesting numerous connections that are either worthy of further exploration or at least provide the fodder for further debate. This book serves as the perfect primer for those interested in exploring the dark side of the genome and understanding some of the perhaps-underappreciated forces that may have acted to shape it.<br> --Ellen J. Pritham (<i>American Journal of Human Biology</i>)</p><h2>The Labour Party: A Marxist History</h2><p>Jeremy Corbyn&#39;s leadership of the Labour Party has given hope to millions of Labour supporters who were deeply disillusioned by Blair&#39;s New Labour. Corbyn stands for opposition to war and neo-liberalism but the Labour Party itself is deeply divided, with many in its parliamentary leadership openly opposed to the hopes of its new mass membership. The British Labour Party has always been an enigma. Labour claims to be socialist but when in government does its best to defend capitalism. Can the Labour Party become the vehicle for socialism in Britain? What is the nature of its politics and the division between left and right within it? Why has its record in government repeatedly disappointed its own supporters? And can Corbyn overcome these contradictions? This path breaking Marxist history of the British Labour Party was first published in 1988. This new and updated third edition contains additional chapters on New Labour and Labour Under Corbyn.</p><p></p><h2>My Home Is Far Away: An Autobiographical Novel</h2><p><i>My Home is Far Away</i> is the most precisely autobiographical of Powell&#x2019;s fifteen novels. In this family chronicle set in early twentieth century Ohio, young Marcia Willard&#x2019; s family struggles to keep up with the rapidly changing times, and Marcia endures disillusionment, cruelty, and betrayal to forge a survivor&#x2019;s sense of independence. John Updike has compared Powell with Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Sherwood Anderson, &#x201c;and those other Midwestern writers who felt something epic in the national shift from rural to urban, from provincial sequestration to metropolitan liberation.&#x201d; By 1941, when Powell set to work on My Home Is Far Away, she was better known for the smart, boozy, bawdy, hilarious send-ups of Manhattan high and low life. She had begun to attain a reputation for high sophistication and nothing could be less &#x201c;sophisticated&#x201d; &#x2013; in the glittering, all-knowing, furiously present-tense, big-city manner Powell had perfected &#x2013; than <i>My Home Is Far Away</i>.<br><br>This was the month of cherries and peaches, of green apples beyond the grape arbor, of little dandelion ghosts in the grass, of sour grass and four-leaf clovers, of still dry heat holding the smell of nasturtiums and dying lilacs. This was the best month of all and the best day. It was not birthday, Easter, Christmas, or picnic, but all these things and something else, something wonderful, something utterly unknown. The two little girls in embroidered white Sunday dresses knew no way to express their secret joy but by whirling each other dizzily over the lawn crying, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re moving, we&#x2019;re moving! We&#x2019;re moving to London Junction!&#x201d;<br><br> <i>My Home Is Far Away</i> is one of the very few examples of a book written for adults, with an adult command of the language, that maintains the vantage point of a hungry, serious child throughout. It might be likened to a memoir that has been penned not with the usual tranquility of distance but rather with the sense that everything happening to the characters is happening right now, without any promise of eventual escape, without any assurance that childhood, too, shall pass away.<br> <i>My Home is Far Away</i> had been out of print for sixty years when Steerforth reissued it in 1995. It received immediate widespread acclaim, and was featured on the cover of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>.</p><p>Dawn Powell was in the midst of writing one of her finest satires, <i>A Time to Be Born</i>, when she contracted a fever that brought childhood memories back so vividly that she stopped her novel and began scrawling reminiscences that were later collected in <i>My Home Is Far Away</i>. Although not true autobiography, the life of the main character, Marcia Willard, parallels Powell's life, including the death of her mother, life with a father who was on the road, and the traumatic remarriage of her father to a vicious and selfish woman. <i>My Home Is Far Away</i> is an excellent depiction of what childcare was like for motherless children in the 19th century in comparison to their family-oriented neighbors.When Dawn Powell died in 1965, virtually all her books were out of print. Not a single historical survey of American literature mentioned her, even in passing. And so she slept, seemingly destined to be forgotten &#x2013; or, to put it more exactly, never to be remembered. <br><br> How things have changed! Numerous novels by Dawn Powell are currently available, along with her diaries and short stories. She has joined the Library of America, admitted to the illustrious company of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Adams, Frederick Douglass, and Edith Wharton. She is taught in college and read with delight on vacation. For the contemporary poet and novelist Lisa Zeidner, writing in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Powell &#x201c;is wittier than Dorothy Parker, dissects the rich better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, is more plaintive than Willa Cather in her evocation of the heartland, and has a more supple control of satirical voice than Evelyn Waugh.&#x201d; For his part, Gore Vidal offered a simple reason for Powell&#x2019;s sudden popularity in the early Twentieth Century: &#x201c;We are catching up to her.&#x201d;<br><br> Dawn Powell was born in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, on November 28, 1896, the second of three daughters. Her father was a traveling salesman, and her mother died a few days after Dawn turned seven. After enduring great cruelty at the hands of her stepmother, Dawn ran away at the age of thirteen and eventually arrived at the home of her maternal aunt, who served hot meals to travelers emerging from the train station across the street. Dawn worked her way through college and made it to New York. There she married a young advertising executive and had one child, a boy who suffered from autism, then an unknown condition.<br><br> Powell referred to herself as a &#x201c;permanent visitor&#x201d; in her adopted Manhattan and brought to her writing a perspective gained from her upbringing in Middle America. She knew many of the great writers of her time, and Diana Trilling famously said it was Dawn &#x201c;who really says the funny things for which Dorothy Parker gets credit.&#x201d; Ernest Hemingway called her his &#x201c;favorite living writer.&#x201d; She was one of America&#x2019; s great novelists, and yet when she died in 1965 she was buried in an unmarked grave in New York&#x2019;s Potter&#x2019;s Field.</p><h2>New Earth (Star Quest Trilogy)</h2><p>hardcover with dust jacket</p><p><p>BEN BOVA is a six-time winner of the Hugo Award, a former editor of <i>Analog</i><i>,</i> former editorial director of <i>Omni</i><i>,</i> and a past president of both the National Space Society and the Science Fiction Writers of America.

He lives in Florida.</p>BEIJING <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Chiang Chantao sat in his powerchair, floating high above the flooded city of St. Louis. <br>&#x201c;This shouldn&#x2019;t be happening,&#x201d; he said, his voice barely more than a pained croak. <br>&#x201c;But it is,&#x201d; said Felicia Ionescu, seemingly standing in midair beside him. <br>What had once been a thriving city was now a drowned disaster, buildings inundated, highways submerged, even the magnificent Gateway Arch&#x2019;s foundations awash in several meters of muddy water. Long lines of miserable refugees were plodding away from the city, automobiles, trucks, buses inching along, bumper to bumper, piled high with mattresses, bicycles, clothes washers, sticks of furniture; others were on foot, sloshing stolidly through the rain, the water knee-deep in some places, carrying babies and bundles of whatever they could salvage from their ruined homes. <br>&#x201c;Kill the display,&#x201d; Chiang commanded. <br>The virtual reality simulation disappeared. Chiang was sitting in his powerchair in the middle of the VR chamber, a wizened, bald, crippled old man connected to the blinking, softly beeping heart pump and artificial lungs and other machinery that kept his emaciated body alive. <br>Felicia Ionescu was a tall, imposing figure, generously proportioned as an old-time opera diva, and just as imperious. At this moment, though, she did not look haughty or domineering. Despite her name, she looked unutterably sad. <br>&#x201c;Demons and devils!&#x201d; Chiang burst. &#x201c;All my life we&#x2019;ve been fighting the sea-level rise. We&#x2019;ve built dams and levees and pumping systems all over the world! We had things under control! And now this.&#x201d; <br>He pointed a wavering clawlike finger at the satellite map of the world that covered one wall of the VR chamber. China&#x2019;s long rivers were now broad arms of the sea reaching a thousand kilometers inland, drowning villages and whole cities, killing hundreds of thousands, wiping out millions upon millions of hectares of productive farmlands. <br>Where once the Mississippi River had wound its peaceful way from the northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, a great inland sea was spreading, flooding Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, reaching up into Missouri and still growing. <br>The Nile was inundating Egypt and the Sudan, drowning the Sphinx and lapping against the great pyramids. The swollen Orinoco River and mighty Amazon had virtually split South America into two separate subcontinents. Coastlines around the world were no longer recognizable: the sea was inexorably conquering the land. <br>&#x201c;This wasn&#x2019;t supposed to happen,&#x201d; Chiang insisted, his voice a painful rasp. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve stopped burning fossil fuels. We&#x2019;ve removed gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not enough,&#x201d; said Ionescu, mournfully. Like Chiang, she spoke Mandarin, but with a Romanian accent that was painful to the old man&#x2019;s ears. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing everything we can,&#x201d; he insisted. <br>&#x201c;We started too late. Despite all our efforts, the global climate has tipped into a warm cycle. The Greenland ice cap is melting. So is Antarctica. And there&#x2019;s nothing we can do to stop it.&#x201d; She took a breath, then added, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re paying for starting too late. We did nothing for more than a century, and now it&#x2019;s too late to prevent the floods.&#x201d; <br>Chiang craned his wattled neck to glare up at her. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re back again to wheedle me into approving a backup mission to Sirius? How many times do I have to tell you it&#x2019;s impossible?&#x201d; <br>Ionescu closed her eyes, then said, as if reciting from rote, &#x201c;As director of the International Astronautical Authority, it is my duty to remind you once again that the exploration program calls for several backup missions.&#x201d; <br>Waving his withered arm toward the satellite imagery again, Chiang demanded, &#x201c;And what do I tell the people of Chongqing? And St. Louis? And Cairo and S�o Paulo and all the other cities that have been flooded? How do we feed the refugees? Where do we house them?&#x201d; <br>Ionescu said, &#x201c;We should have launched the first backup mission seventy-five years ago, long before either you or I came into power.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do you know what the Council would do if I recommended we send a backup mission to Sirius?&#x201d; Chiang screeched. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d flay me alive and nail me to the gate of the Forbidden City!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You exaggerate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked all my life to save our world from disaster. I&#x2019;ve fought my way to chairmanship of the World Council. I&#x2019;m not going to allow the IAA or any force on Earth to distract me from my purpose.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s less than two and a half billion kiloyuan for the first backup mission,&#x201d; Ionescu replied, her voice rising slightly. &#x201c;We have all the basic facilities in place. We have the organizational infrastructure.&#x201d; <br>Chiang took a deep breath, while the life-support equipment on the back of his chair chattered angrily. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the <i>amount</i> of money, woman, it&#x2019;s the symbolism. Here we&#x2019;re struck with the worst disaster since the original greenhouse floods five generations ago, and you want to spend badly needed funds on sending another team of pampered scientists to Sirius! It&#x2019;s impossible!&#x201d; <br>Working hard to control her own volatile temper, Ionescu said, &#x201c;The first team should have reached Sirius by now. They&#x2019;re only twelve people&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If they need help let them ask for it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Their messages take more than eight years to get here. They&#x2019;re effectively alone, isolated.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your predecessors knew that when they sent them, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course, but our original program plan called for a backup mission. Several of them, in fact.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Those plans are canceled,&#x201d; Chiang snapped. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re underwater. Drowned. Just like the village of my birth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be this way,&#x201d; Ionescu said, almost pleading. &#x201c;Twelve people, alone out there&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to have to make the best of it,&#x201d; Chiang said. &#x201c;Just as we are.&#x201d; <br>Ionescu turned from Chiang&#x2019;s age-ravaged, angry face and stared at the wall-sized satellite display. But in her mind&#x2019;s eye she saw the starship taking up its preplanned orbit around the planet Sirius C. New Earth. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Ben Bova <br></p><h2>The Finishing Touch: Becoming God&#39;s Masterpiece: A Daily Devotional</h2><p><p>In fast-food society we long for quick fixes and easy answers.

Recent projects include the Oscar-winning <i>Gods and Monsters</i> and an exhibition of erotic paintings and photographs, "The Weird and the Wicked." He lives with his lover, the photographer David Armstrong, in Los Angeles, along with a family of dogs, rats, geckoes, iguanas, and turtles.</p>Dazzling metaphysical epic-adventure as Barker surpasses his previous ground-breaking work (The Great and Secret Show, 1989, etc.) to reconfigure the Fall and to imagine a modern-day attempt to reverse it. A complex cosmology underpins the vigorous, at times horrific, action here: ``Imajica'' is the known universe of five ``Dominions,'' or parallel worlds, four ``reconciled'' but the fifth, Earth, ``unreconciled''--unaware of the other four, of the tyrannical ``Autarch'' who rules them, and of the ``God Hapeximendios,'' who oversees all five (and who wrested ``His'' power from the ``Goddesses'' of old). Periodically, Hapeximendios has sent His ``sons''--including Christ--to attempt to unite, by magical rites, the Fifth Dominion to the others. The last attempted ``Reconciliation'' ended in catastrophe--an invasion of Earth by hellish powers--and today magic has been nearly eradicated from Earth by a ``Society'' that alone knows of the Imajica and of the catastrophe. The densely woven story here opens with a jealous man venturing into London's dankest slum to hire an assassin to kill his estranged wife, Judith; the assassin turns out to be a ``mystif,'' a fabulous creature from the Second Dominion, capable of appearing as the erotic ideal of any who behold it. As the mystif hunts Judith, it in turn is hunted by Judith's former lover, ``Gentle,'' who in time learns that he is the new ``Reconciler''- -and the mystif his long-forgotten servant. Undertaking dangerous, splendor-filled journeys through the other Dominions, Gentle and the mystif fall in love, marry, and encounter numerous fantastic creatures and, finally, death; later, Gentle helps dethrone the Autarch, learns the chilling secret of his and Judith's origin, helps free the Goddesses and slay God, and, back on Earth, inspires the destruction of the Society and undertakes Reconciliation--with hell-borne, then heaven-sent, results. An astonishing feat of the imagination, immensely engrossing despite its demanding--at times indulgent--length, running riot with ideas, fantastical inventions, graphic sex and violence, soul- terrors, and emotional and intellectual resonances.

And while the world celebrated the extraordinary revelation that gave Carter international renown and an indelible place in history, by the time of his death, the discovery had nearly destroyed him. Now, in a stunning feat of narrative nonfiction, Daniel Meyerson has written a thrilling and evocative account of this remarkable man and his times.<br> <p><br> Carter began his career inauspiciously. At the age of seventeenunknown, untrained, untriedhe was hired as a copyist of tomb art by the brash, brilliant, and boldly unkempt father of modern archaeology, W. F. Petrie. Carter struck out on his own a few years later, sensing that something amazing lay buried beneath his feet, waiting for him to uncover it.<br> </p><p><br> But others had the same idea: The ancient cities of Egypt were crawling with European adventurers and their wealthy sponsors, each hoping to outdo the others with glittering discoverieseven as growing nationalist resentment against foreigners plundering the countrys most treasured antiquities simmered dangerously in the background.<br> </p><p><br> Not until Carter met up with the risk-taking, adventure-loving occultist Lord Carnarvon did his fortunes change. There were stark differences in personality and temperament between the cantankerous Carter and his gregarious patron, but together they faced down endless ridicule from the most respected explorers of the day. Seven dusty and dispiriting years after their first meeting, their dream came to astonishing life. <br> </p><p><br> But there would be a price to pay for this partnership, their discovery, and the glory and fame it brought both menand the chain of events that transpired in the wake of their success remains fascinating and shocking to this day.<br> </p><p><br> An enthralling story told with unprecedented verve, In the Valley of the Kings is a tale of mania and greed, of fame and lost fortune, of history and its damnations. As he did in The Linguist and the Emperor, Daniel Meyerson puts his exciting storytelling powers on full display, revealing an almost forgotten time when past and present came crashing together with the power to changeor cursemens lives.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon.com Best of the Month, May 2009:</strong> Hewn from his discovery of the treasure-laden tomb of Tutankhamum, the legacy of famed archeologist Howard Carter invokes notions of adventure, dark curses, and untold riches. Yet as cinematic as such stories may be, they are incongruous with a man who carved out an isolated existence sifting through the unforgiving desert sands. Author Daniel Meyerson maintains that the real story of Howard Carter is about struggle and pride, not gold and silver. At a time when archeology was dominated by the upper classes of society, Carter's lack of a genteel upbringing created a rather large chip on his shoulder. A desire to silence critics consumed him, and nearly lead to his own undoing "The same driven quality that enabled him to find Tut's tomb," explains Meyerson, "also brought about his downfall." Had a series of timely events not provided Carter a second chance at glory, one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century could very well still lie buried in Egypt&#x2019;s Valley of the Kings. <em>-- Dave Callanan</em> <br> <br> <strong>Look Inside <em>In the Valley of the Kings</em></strong> <p></p> <p></p> <strong>Click on thumbnails for larger images</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Howard Carter seated beside the coffin of King Tutankhamun 1926. � Griffith Institute,University</td> <td>Howard Carter, May 8, 1924 � National Photo Company Collection, Library of Congress</td> <td>Statues of Memnon in Thebes. � Francis Frith, Library of Congress</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <br>Daniel Meyerson, an Ellis Fellow at Columbia University, has taught writing at Columbia, New York University, and Bennington College.

It wasn� TMt my purpose to share beyond family and friends but as the years passed and I continued to tell my story, more and more people began urging me to write. My previous thoughts and writing came into clearer focus as I took time to put together a book. Offers came from different groups for publication but it seemed the timing wasn't right. The experience was a very personal and sacred one and I somehow didn't feel comfortable about its publication. <p> However as the years passed and an invitation came from the Pacific Press to publish the book, I felt it was time to share. My sincere hope now is that this book might inspire and encourage others that God does hear and answer prayers as He did for me. Behind the miracle of a rescue from an ice floe in the Arctic is the story of a shy little girl who had a dream � � a dream of being a flying missionary someday. God responded to that dream in His own way and His own timing and for this I am deeply grateful. I know there is a God, a very personal One who answers the prayers of even little people with big dreams of serving Him.</p></p><h2>Agatha Christie&#39;s Detectives: Five Complete Novels</h2><p>Tales of mystery, adventure, and detection feature Agatha Christie&#39;s favorite sleuths--Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Superintendent Battle, and Tommy and Tuppence Beresford</p><p></p><h2>The Zurich Axioms: Secrets of the Swiss Investment Bankers</h2><p>Offers advice on investment strategy and risk management, clears up common misconceptions about the stock market, and discusses economic forecasts and long-range planning</p><p>Max Gunther was born in England and emigrated to the US when he was 11.

In fact there is no 'right' age as every baby is different.<br><br>Physiologically, there is no rush to get your baby started on solids. A baby's digestive system is not fully matured for the first few months and foreign proteins very early on may increase the likelihood of allergic food problems later. However, be warned, socially there is a kind of competitive spirit amongst mothers to get their child on to pur�ed steak and fries as soon as possible! I would advise that, provided your child is satisfied and growing properly, you should wait until he is between four and six months old before starting to give him simple solid foods.<br><br><i>Milk is Still the Major Food</i><br><br>It is very important to remember when starting your baby on solids that milk is still the most natural and the best food for growing babies. I would encourage mothers to try breast-feeding. Apart from the emotional benefits, breast milk contains antibodies that help protect infants from infection. In the first few months, they are particularly vulnerable and the colostrum a mother produces in the first few days of breast-feeding is a very important source of antibodies which help to build up a baby's immune system. (There are enormous benefits in breast-feeding your child even for as little as one week.) It is also medically proven that breast-fed babies are less likely to develop certain diseases in later life.<br><br>Milk should contain all the nutrients that your baby needs to grow. There are 65 calories in 4 fl oz (1/2 cup) of milk and formula milk is fortified with vitamins and, for babies over 4 months, also with iron. Cow's milk is not such a 'complete' food for human babies so is best not started until your baby is one year old. Solids are introduced to add <i>bulk</i> to a baby's diet, and to introduce new tastes, textures and aromas; they also help the baby to practise using the muscles in his mouth. But giving a baby too much solid food too early may lead to constipation, and fewer nutrients than he needs. It would be very difficult for a baby to get the equivalent amount of nutrients from the small amount of solids as he gets from his milk.<br><br>Do not use softened water when making up your baby's bottle or repeatedly boiled water because of the danger of concentrating mineral salts. Babies' bottles should not be warmed in a microwave, as the milk may be too hot even though the bottle feels cool to the touch. Warm bottles standing in hot water.<br><br>There is no fixed rule as to how much milk a baby should consume during the day. However, it is important to make sure (especially as it is highly likely that a bottle may not be finished at each feed) that up to the age of five months, your baby drinks milk at least four times a day. If the number of feeds is reduced too quickly, your baby will not be able to drink as much as is needed. Some mothers make the mistake of giving their baby solid food when he or she is hungry, when what he really needs is an additional milk feed.<br><br>Although most babies of six months are perfectly able to drink pasteurised cow s milk and many mothers, especially in other countries, start their babies on cow's milk this early, it is best to continue with breast or formula milk for one year.<br><br>Dairy products like yogurt and cheese can be introduced after six months and are usually very popular with babies. Choose whole milk products rather than low-fat.<br><br><i>Fresh is Best</i><br><br>Fresh foods just <i>do</i> taste, smell and look better than jars of pre-prepared baby foods. Neither is there any doubt that, prepared correctly, they are better for your baby (and you), for it is inevitable nutrients, especially vitamins, are lost in the processing of pre-prepared baby foods. Home-made food tastes quite different from the jars you can buy. (If you were ever to try a blind tasting of popular brands of baby foods, you would know that it is very difficult to recognise what particular food each jar contains!)<br><br>There is also a very limited variety of single fruit and vegetables. Most of the jars available contain bland combinations of foods pur�ed to the same consistency so that it is difficult for your child to differentiate one food from another. It can be quite a problem getting your baby to accept the coarser texture of home-made purees once he is used to the very smooth texture of commercially prepared baby foods. It s best therefore to start cooking for your baby yourself right from the beginning. I believe your child is less likely to become a fussy eater if he is used to a wide selection of tastes and textures from a very early age. You can 'train' your child to enjoy the flavors of fresh spinach or apple and pea pur�e rather than crave candy and doughnuts. Why give them sugary and fatty foods when healthy food can be just as enjoyable?<br><br><i>Your Baby's Nutritional Requirements</i><br><br>The following six are essential nutrients that a child needs for a healthy diet and to promote growth.<br><br>PROTEINS<br><br>Proteins are needed for the growth and repair of our bodies, any extra can be used to provide energy (or is deposited as fat).<br><br>Proteins are made up of different amino acids. Some foods; meat, fish, dairy produce including cheeses, and soybeans, contain all the amino acids that are essential to our bodies. Other foods; grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, are still valuable sources of protein but do not contain all the essential amino acids.<br><br>CARBOHYDRATES<br><br>Carbohydrates and fat provide our bodies with their main source of energy.

The body also needs to store some fat to prevent excessive loss of body heat. Thus a certain amount of fat is essential in everyone's diet. Foods that contain fats also contain the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. The problem is that many people eat too much fat and the wrong type of fat.<br><br>There are two types of fat - saturated, which mainly comes from animal sources, and unsaturated which comes from vegetable sources. It is the saturated fats which are the most harmful and which may lead to high cholesterol levels and coronary disease later in life.<br><br>It is important to give your baby whole milk for at least the first two years but try to reduce fats in cooking and use butter and margarine in moderation. Try to reduce saturated fats in your child's diet by cutting down on red meat, especially fatty meats like lamb; replace with more chicken and fish.

The children most at risk are those who follow a Vegan diet (i.e. no animal products at all) and those drinking cow's milk from the age of six months. Pediatricians recommend that these children should take a daily vitamin supplement until they are at least two.<br><br>For most children eating fresh food in sufficient quantity and drinking breast or formula milk until one year of age, vitamin supplements are unnecessary.<br><br>There are two types of vitamins - water-soluble (C and B complex) and fat-soluble (A, D, E and K). Water-soluble vitamins cannot be stored by the body so foods containing these should be eaten daily. They can also easily be destroyed by overcooking, especially when fruit and vegetables are boiled in water. You should try to preserve these vitamins by eating the foods raw or just lightly cooked (in a steamer, for instance).<br><br>There is some controversy over whether vitamin supplements can improve your child's IQ. As vitamins are necessary for the correct development of the brain and nervous system, it is important that a good supply of all vitamins is taken. However, a good balanced diet should supply all that is required and an excess of vitamins is potentially harmful.

Some babies (and older children) can also react to artificial food colorings and additives. The commonest allergic problems which may be triggered by adverse reactions to food are: nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; asthma; eczema; hayfever; rashes and swelling of the eyes, lips and face. This is one reason it is unwise to rush starting your baby on solid foods.<br><br>There is no need to be unduly worried about food allergy, unless there is a family history. The incidence of food allergy in normal babies is extremely small and, with the tendency to a later introduction of solid food between four and six months, they have become even less common. However, it is still children under the age of eighteen months who are most likely to develop an allergy to a particular food. Although a lot of children 'grow out of it' by the age of two, some food allergies - particularly a sensitivity to eggs, milk, shellfish or nuts - can last for life. If your child has an allergy, do tell friend's mums and the school when he is old enough.<br><br>Never be afraid to take your baby to the doctor if you are worried that there is something wrong. Young babies' immune systems are not fully matured and babies can become ill very quickly if they are not treated properly and can develop serious complications.<br><br>LACTOSE INTOLERANCE<br><br>Lactose intolerance is not actually an allergy. Children who suffer lactose intolerance lack the substance lactase, an enzyme present in the superficial layers of the small bowel, which breaks lactose down to simpler sugars. Lactose is present in all milks and these babies will not be able to drink breast or cow's milk. A soy formula is given.<br><br>Some children who are lactose intolerant are able to eat dairy products like cheese and yogurt with no ill effects.<br><br>COW'S MILK PROTEIN ALLERGY<br><br>If your baby is sensitive to cow's milk, consult your doctor who will probably recommend a soy-based milk formula. Unmodified soy milk is not suitable as it is nutritionally inadequate. However, some babies who are allergic to cow's milk are also allergic to soy-based milks and for those babies there are a number of hypo-allergic milk formulas available on prescription. Breast milk is the best milk for babies who are allergic to cow's milk but mothers may need to limit dairy foods themselves as...</p><h2>Evangelization of the New World</h2><p>Teach history through a quick-moving narrative that captures the imagination and challenges the reason by asking the student to apply Catholic social principles to the stories of history.

B. Jackson Book Prize from the Foundation for Landscape Studies</p><p>Landscape architect, urban planner, teacher, and social visionary: over the course of a sixty-year career, Lawrence Halprin (1916-2009) reshaped the spaces we inhabit and our ways of moving through them. The <em>New York Times</em> called him "the tribal elder of American landscape architecture" and the critic Ada Louise Huxtable credited him with creating what "may be one of the most important urban spaces since the Renaissance." His bold use of abstract imagery could evoke the landscape of the American West in a sequence of city squares and fountains, while his plan for repurposing an abandoned factory near San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf showed how adaptive use of a historic structure could turn commercial development into urban theater. A man who deeply loved cities, he left as one of his most important legacies the five thousand acres of coastline, hedgerows, and meadows that became Sonoma County's environmentally sensitive and enormously influential Sea Ranch.</p><p>Featuring more than ninety black-and-white and one hundred color reproductions of photographs, plans, and sketchbooks, <em>A Life Spent Changing Places</em> is Halprin's own account of how a young boy who listened to the fireside chats of FDR on the radio became the man who designed the memorial to that president in the nation's capital. It is a book about the invention and reinvention of an extraordinary man over the span of decades and how he helped to reframe the world around him.</p></p><p>A transplanted Brooklynite, Lawrence Halprin began his professional career in San Francisco in 1949, and his work over the next 60 years spanned the country, from Oregon to Virginia. Among his publications are The RSVP Cycles: Creative Processes in the Human Environment (1969) and The Sea Ranch: Diary of an Idea (2003). Laurie Olin is Practice Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and Principal of the Olin Partnership, a landscape architecture firm in Philadelphia. He is coauthor of La Foce: A Garden and Landscape in Tuscany and Vizcaya: An American Villa and Its Makers, both available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>Foreword<br>Laurie Olin</p><p>Lawrence Halprin was a great landscape architect. He was also a strong advocate for community, sociability, cities, and nature. The remark that "Every great artist inhabits a genre, and remakes it" could find no better proof than in his life and work. He produced a series of masterpieces of iconic stature: Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco; Sea Ranch on the north California coast; the Lovejoy and Ira Keller Fountain sequence in Portland, Oregon; Freeway Park in Seattle, Washington; the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, D.C.; and Stern Grove Theater in San Francisco, to name some of the best known. He knew plants horticulturally and could use them architecturally. Many of his greatest works were executed with humble, ordinary building materials: concrete, asphalt, stucco, wood, soil, and plants. As he matured and whenever he could, he utilized natural stone and water.</p><p>Between 1949 and 1961, long before he produced the works for which he is known today, he designed more than three hundred residential gardens in the San Francisco Bay region. Two of these were major steps in his development and have entered the canon of midcentury American landscape design. The first was at his own house (1952) designed by William Wurster, an architect he'd met as a student at Harvard. A key element was a detached redwood dance deck made for his wife. On this nonrectangular platform she developed many of her avant-garde works, with a number of young dancers who were to become future leaders in the field such as Merce Cunningham. Anna Halprin credited its free shape and multilevels with helping her to explore space, the body, its senses, and its perceptions. In turn Halprin has credited his experience with her work as having had a major influence in developing his ideas of movement and sequence in spatial terms. The other generative early project, the McIntyre garden in Hillsborough, California (1959), he designed with Joseph Esherick, another architect with whom he was to work later&#x2014;most importantly at the Sea Ranch. In it one can see Halprin beginning to survey and reflect upon the history of landscape design and see that he was trying his hand at materials both contemporary and timeless, particularly masonry and water, with ideas drawn from well-known historical works to see how he measured up.</p><p>By the late 1950s, with a large body of domestic-scale projects behind him, his practice began to expand to take on commercial work such as shopping centers with architects Richard Marsh Bennett outside Chicago and Eero Saarinen near Dallas. Aspects of these commercial developments anticipate the important civic plans and spaces, fountains and plazas he was to design later. In these early suburban malls we see his use of concrete, stepped levels, and angular shapes; sequences of spaces that narrow, swell, change direction; fountains; and idiosyncratic custom furnishing. These projects, like some of his finest later work, have unfortunately been so heavily copied and thoroughly absorbed into the vernacular of late twentieth-century urban development that they now appear as clich�. At the time, however, he and his staff were designing and building a new kind of public space, flowing free-form pedestrian ways between shops in the new marketplaces of America.</p><p>The period from 1956 to 1961 was one of enormous personal, intellectual, artistic, and professional growth, during which he began taking trips to the high Sierras, hiking, sketching, and photographing the mountains, rocks, and vegetation, and especially the water in all its moods and situations. Although he had drawn for pleasure and amusement since college days it was in this period that he began regularly keeping sketchbooks for drawing, recording his observations and making studies and notes for projects. A fierce appetite for experience and persistent observation recorded directly on the spot honed his visual acuity and fed his design repertoire. This graphic skill became an important tool in Halprin's design process, contributing significantly to his success.</p><p>In the summer of 1961 Halprin took a trip with his daughter Daria to Europe and Israel largely to study their cities, streets, plazas, waterfronts, great gardens, and classical sites. One outcome was the book <i>Cities</i>, published two years later. This survey and meditation on the character of both ordinary and outstanding furnishings of European civic spaces almost immediately fed directly into a sequence of commissions in which he explored and experimented with urban design typologies. These were to include Ghirardelli Square, Embarcadero Plaza, and Market Street in San Francisco; Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis; the Seattle World's Fair site; and a pedestrian mall in Charlottesville, Virginia. In this work Halprin developed experimental processes he called scores and <i>motation</i>, personal and somewhat idiosyncratic systems to graphically record, study, and script human movement through sequences of space and topography and to describe the particular character of the each space.</p><p>The Ghirardelli development (1965) shows Halprin revisiting the ideas and character of his earlier suburban shopping centers through the filter of his recent European experience. When asked for ideas regarding the site of an abandoned nineteenth-century chocolate factory above Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, he suggested that rather than clearing the buildings for new development, which was (and often still is) the habit of the day, he suggested the project should save most of the brick structures, while at the same time cutting into them so as to open views to the bay below and creating a series of stairs and ramps linking their levels and the adjacent streets to a collection of shops around several small plazas. It was a brilliant and pioneering example of adaptive reuse producing a form of urban theater within commercial development.</p><p>Another typology he challenged in this period was that of the traditional street as it had evolved, choked with automobiles, in twentieth-century America. His experiment with a transit mall in Minneapolis intrigued designers all over while it terrorized engineers and puzzled businessmen. His proposal asked why couldn't the road or bus-way wander sinuously within the right-of-way, like a river, creating varying and more generous widths alternately on either side for pedestrians instead of the habitual narrow straight sidewalks. This arrangement would allow for amenities such as bus shelters, art, fountains, planting, and seating (all of which he also designed) along the course of the street that simply would not fit on the normal twelve- to sixteen-foot-wide walks of most American streets. Nicollet Mall set in motion several decades of experiment and street improvement projects in the core of American cities and towns.</p><p>Halprin's plan for the five-thousand-acre Sea Ranch project was a innovation in twentieth-century American design. Spending a great amount of time on the site, Halprin, walking, drawing, and studying it, proposed to preserve the character of a former sheep ranch with ten miles of rugged coastline, hedgerows, and meadows. His response to and exploitation of the wind, rocks, spaces, and views prefigured subsequent ecological planning a decade later.</p><p>Working with the Portland, Oregon, Redevelopment Authority in 1965, Halprin proposed an open-space system consisting of three one-acre parks linked by pedestrian lanes. The resultant squares, Lovejoy Plaza, Pettigrove Park, and the Auditorium Forecourt (now known as the Ira Keller Fountain), brought together Halprin's creative energy and one of his deepest inspirations, that of a particular group of streams and waterfalls in Yosemite National Park. The first plaza contained a representation of a mountain, an abstract one in concrete, sharp edged, with a waterfall coming from its top that tumbled and fell into a calm pool with stepping-stones below, inviting people to participate. It was like nothing else in America at the time in its palette, forms, or imagery. Pettigrove Park in the middle of the development is quiet and green, a stunning contrast to Lovejoy Plaza, consisting of a series of mounds, trees, paths, low walls, and benches. The canopy and green surfaces that rise above one's head and fill the visual field form an oasis, a refuge that is as unexpected as the waterfall at Lovejoy. The strength and pure forms of the mounds is striking even today. The culmination of the Portland sequence is the giant Auditorium Forecourt fountain plaza. Here tons of water fall with a roar from an upper plaza to a sunken basin eighteen feet below. As at Lovejoy the elements are concrete, water, and plants. It is a pure landscape. There are no benches, no lights, and no furnishings. The cubic forms of concrete are superb, with an aggregate of different sizes exposed in the various parts. Some of the plaza is fine and delicate, barely more than a sand finish, some pebbly, while other areas have large river cobbles. It is a splendid abstraction of a glaciated mountain landscape.</p><p>With the Portland projects Halprin changed the course of landscape architecture by reintroducing representation and reference as content in design. His early postwar gardens, like those of his mentor Thomas Church and contemporaries Robert Royston and Garrett Eckbo, were skillful in their expression of an evolving western lifestyle. They solved problems and created particular spaces and zones for activities such as automobile parking, children's play, swimming, barbecuing, adult social gathering, and sunbathing. They were the epitome of functionalism and exemplars of a relatively new version of suburban life, often possessing striking geometric form. In Portland, Halprin took the forms and technique he had acquired and produced a work of art that was as representational as any figurative painting could be about a western regional landscape. He retrieved one of the most powerful aspects of historic landscape design without the trappings of neoclassical iconography. It was abstract, modern, and powerful. People responded to it.</p><p>Halprin lived with contradictions in ways that for him were complementary rather than oppositional. He loved cars and driving; he loved to walk and hike; he loved cities; he loved farms; he loved wild nature. He chose to live in the woods next to Mount Tamalpais on the peninsula north of San Francisco and to have a sequence of offices in the bustling center of the city. He admired both urbanity and highways; writing and publishing books about both while trying to work out ways to plan for each that were equally expressive and logical. Literature and criticism to date in the field of landscape architecture, its history and theory, have focused primarily upon his gardens and urban plazas, and to a large extent have not assessed the many urban planning and design projects he and his office undertook. This may be due partly to the time it takes for such work to bear fruit, partly to their lack of visual panache, and partly to the fate many have eventually suffered.</p><p>If one measure of his greatness is the number and quality of handsome and important places he created, another is how he contributed to changes in the practice of landscape architecture and the processes of public works. Larry Halprin managed to do so while rejecting the office practice and business model that evolved during his lifetime and was employed by many of his contemporaries and competitors partly in order to do projects at the scale he frequently worked at. Hideo Sasaki, Garrett Eckbo, Ed Stone Jr., Ian McHarg, Peter Walker, and other contemporaries who began with small practices developed offices that adopted corporate structures, often with large staff, multiple partners, and branches. Halprin approached and backed away from this situation, managing to maintain a studio atmosphere with personal and artistic control of all the work.</p><p>Aspects of several of his methods in one guise or another have become accepted and normal, at times even obligatory, public processes throughout America and Europe. Recording and designing events he borrowed an appropriate term from music, the score, while working with artists, psychologists, scientists, and designers and with key assistants and friends to develop what evolved into his RSVP process of workshops in an attempt to resist preconceived forms and ideas, or determinist quasi-scientific methodologies. Halprin strove to work in a way that would allow an open process with feedback that engaged clients, communities, stakeholders, and designers equally through a series of exercises and explorative activities individually and as a group. Despite the strong influence of Jungian psychology and a genuine (and generous) liberal political urge to respond to the needs of others, Halprin consistently controlled the design response to this input, maintaining a strong personal artistic expression in form and imagery.</p><p>Halprin's first professional public goal-oriented workshop took place in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1979. After putting civic leaders and influential businessmen through orientation and sensitivity exercises in the older heart of the city, he coaxed them through sessions that led to goals, a program and a framework that encompassed public and private transportation, parking, and mixed-use commercial and residential developments, as well as pedestrian ways, public plazas, and parks. This led to an ambitious plan for eight miles of the Trinity River corridor that included drives, parks, and recreation areas reminiscent of some of the best of the WPA projects of the Great Depression, as well as proposals for reshaping portions of the river, landings, and commercial and residential development. With this and other schemes in his office at this period, Halprin was thirty years ahead of his time. Some aspects of the plan were taken up and realized by the business community, albeit only those that facilitated commuters and commerce in the downtown, while few of the civic spaces or park proposals were implemented. It was only after the beginning of the twenty-first century that some of his proposals for the river and its development for residential use and recreation have been revived and one of the only public spaces he managed to realize in Fort Worth, Heritage Plaza, overlooking the Trinity River, derelict at the time of this writing, is in the process of restoration.</p><p>Unlike a number of other leading American landscape architects of his generation Halprin had little involvement with academia. For reasons of personality and the pressure of his practice, by the 1970s Halprin had come to avoid the environmental design school at Berkeley, where he had once had close friends, even running a couple of experimental summer studios. His alma mater, Harvard, was far away and didn't seem very welcoming, either. He and Ian McHarg, who had published Design with Nature in 1969, were great admirers of each other's work. McHarg managed to persuade him to come to the University of Pennsylvania to spend time with the students in their design studios during the period that he was deeply involved in the Roosevelt Memorial and traveling to the East Coast for periods of time.</p><p>In the heart of Portland, Seattle, and Denver Halprin explored and produced bold and origina...</p></p><h2>Herzog on Herzog: Conversations with Paul Cronin</h2><p><p><b>An invaluable set of career-length interviews with the German genius hailed by Fran�ois Truffaut as "the most important film director alive"</b></p><p>Most of what we've heard about Werner Herzog is untrue.

As the population of the world doubled once, and then again, well-meaning people concluded that only population control could preserve the "quality of life." This movement eventually spanned the globe and carried out a series of astonishing experiments, from banning Asian immigration to paying poor people to be sterilized. </p><p> Supported by affluent countries, foundations, and non-governmental organizations, the population control movement experimented with ways to limit population growth. But it had to contend with the Catholic Church's ban on contraception and nationalist leaders who warned of "race suicide." The ensuing struggle caused untold suffering for those caught in the middle--particularly women and children. It culminated in the horrors of sterilization camps in India and the one-child policy in China. </p><p> Matthew Connelly offers the first global history of a movement that changed how people regard their children and ultimately the face of humankind. It was the most ambitious social engineering project of the twentieth century, one that continues to alarm the global community. Though promoted as a way to lift people out of poverty--perhaps even to save the earth--family planning became a means to plan other people&#x2018;s families. </p><p> With its transnational scope and exhaustive research into such archives as Planned Parenthood and the newly opened Vatican Secret Archives, Connelly's withering critique uncovers the cost inflicted by a humanitarian movement gone terribly awry and urges renewed commitment to the reproductive rights of all people. </p></p><p><b>Matthew Connelly</b> is Professor of History, Columbia University.Passionate and troubling...Connelly tells the story of the 20th-century international movement to control population, which he sees as an oppressive movement that failed to deliver the promised economic and environmental results...Ambitious, exhaustively researched and clearly written, this is a highly important book.

(James J. Hughes <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i> 2008-05-29)<br><br>Mr. Connelly's story is a global one, partly because so many of the groups seeking to influence the reproduction of others were transnational, but also because often it was those in one country who wished those in another to have fewer children...Mr. Connelly's most devastating critique of population control is not that it destroyed lives, or was based on imperialist or eugenic ideas, but that it did not work.

Since 1987, Warren has led his own architectural firm, Charles Warren, Architect, which designs projects in diverse locations from New England to Florida, as well as in metropolitan New York, where the practice is based. In addition, Charles Warren has published numerous essays on architecture.(EXCERPT) THE new two-volume monograph Carrere &amp; Hastings Architects is the first book to shine a spotlight on an effervescent design team whose legacy in New York has been lasting, from its introduction of the Beaux-Arts style in the 1890s to its debonair skyscraper for the Standard Oil Company on lower Broadway in the 1920s. Published by Acanthus Press, this comprehensive account of the lifework of John Merven Carrere and Thomas Hastings depicts an organization international in scope with works from London to Vicksburg to Rome to Vancouver but at the same time supremely grounded in New York, dedicated to the civilizing possibilities of the new metropolis. The two volumes, with contributions from Mark Alan Hewitt, Kate Lemos, William Morrison and Charles D. Warren, naturally pay great attention to the men s best-known commissions in New York, like the Frick mansion and the New York Public Library. What is unusual is the attention they pay to the other works which form a network suggesting a comprehensive view of what could truly be a City Beautiful. Bringing an intelligence and sophistication to New York that has never been surpassed, the two designers arrived in the early 1880s after several years at the ??cole des Beaux-Arts, white hot with the newest ideas from Paris.

Colin Wells&#x2019;s vivid account is now available in an up-to-date second edition.</p><p>The Roman empire begins with Julius, the first Caesar, and ends five centuries later with the establishment of Christian rule in Western Europe. C. M. Wells chronicles the astonishing growth of the empire through military innovations that gave soldiers and colonists a tangible stake in Rome&#39;s success through the award of captured lands. He helps make sense out of complex episodes in Roman history, among them the so-called year of the four emperors and the rise of non-Roman rulers such as Maximinus. Wells also looks at the legacy of the Roman empire in modern governments, which derive much knowledge about administration, road building, hydrology, and assorted other practical arts from their ancient forebears.Colin Wells is Professor of Classical Studies, Trinity University.</p><h2>On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena</h2><p>In that wide field of psychopathic deficiency where Science has demarcated the diseases of epilepsy, hysteria and neurasthenia, we meet scattered observations concerning certain rare states of consciousness as to whose meaning authors are not yet agreed. These observations spring up sporadically in the literature on narcolepsy, lethargy, automatisme ambulatoire, periodic amnesia, double consciousness, somnambulism, pathological dreamy states, pathological lying, etc. These states are sometimes attributed to epilepsy, sometimes to hysteria, sometimes to exhaustion of the nervous system, or neurasthenia, sometimes they are allowed all the dignity of a disease sui generis. Patients occasionally work through a whole graduated scale of diagnoses, from epilepsy, through hysteria, up to simulation. In practice, on the one hand, these conditions can only be separated with great difficulty from the so-called neuroses, sometimes even are indistinguishable from them; on the other, certain features in the region of pathological deficiency present more than a mere analogical relationship not only with phenomena of normal psychology, but also with the psychology of the supernormal, of genius. Various as are the individual phenomena in this region, there is certainly no case that cannot be connected by some intermediate example with the other typical cases. This relationship in the pictures presented by hysteria and epilepsy is very close. Recently the view has even been maintained that there is no clean-cut frontier between epilepsy and hysteria, and that a difference is only to be noted in extreme cases. Steffens says, for example[1]&#x2014;&#x201c;We are forced to the conclusion that in essence hysteria and epilepsy are not fundamentally different, but that the cause of the disease is the same but is manifest in a diverse form, in different intensity and permanence.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>The History of Smith &amp; Wesson Firearms</h2><p>The definitive guide to one of the world's best known firearms makers.<br></p><p>This fascinating book provides a detailed history of one of the most famous, and controversial, firearms manufacturers, and its products. Smith &amp; Wesson was founded in 1852 by two men, Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson who shared a dream of developing a new type of firearm, one capable of being fired repeatedly without the annoyance of having to reload with loose powder, ball, and primer. Their ideas moved firearms manufacturing out of the muzzleloading era that had dominated the industry since the invention of the hand cannon in the 14th century.<br>Since then, the company has produced countless pistols and revolvers that have become standard issue to police and armed forces throughout the world, and which have also been used by sport shooters and criminals. In addition, these famous firearms have been featured in several sensational Hollywood movies, including Dirty Harry.<br>Complete with more than 200 full-color photographs, this stunning book describes the range of Smith &amp; Wesson firearms in detail, and features cutaway drawings to show the mechanisms, along with detailed technical evaluations. As well as being of interest to enthusiasts and historians, it will be an excellent reference work and an invaluable guide for collectors. It is part of a series of books on famous firearms by the same author, which includes The History of Colt Firearms and The History of Winchester Firearms.<br>Dean K.

Yet today, almost one hundred years later, Mahler has displaced Beethoven as a box-office draw and exerts a unique influence on both popular music and film scores.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mahler&#x2019;s coming-of-age began with such 1960s phenomena as Leonard Bernstein&#x2019;s boxed set of his symphonies and Luchino Visconti&#x2019;s film <i>Death in Venice,</i> which used Mahler&#x2019;s music in its sound track. But that was just the first in a series of waves that established Mahler not just as a great composer but also as an oracle with a personal message for every listener. There are now almost two thousand recordings of his music, which has become an irresistible launchpad for young maestros such as Gustavo Dudamel.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why Mahler? Why does his music affect us in the way it does? <br>&nbsp;<br>Norman Lebrecht, one of the world&#x2019;s most widely read cultural commentators, has been wrestling obsessively with Mahler for half his life. Pacing out his every footstep from birthplace to grave, scrutinizing his manuscripts, talking to those who knew him, Lebrecht constructs a compelling new portrait of Mahler as a man who lived determinedly outside his own times. Mahler was&#x2014;along with Picasso, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, and Joyce&#x2014;a maker of our modern world.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mahler dealt with issues I could recognize,&#x201d; writes Lebrecht, &#x201c;with racism, workplace&nbsp; chaos, social conflict, relationship breakdown, alienation, depression, and the limitations of medical knowledge.&#x201d; <i>Why Mahler? </i>is a book that shows how music can change our lives.</p></p><p><p><b>Norman Lebrecht</b> has written several best-selling works of nonfiction, including <i>The Maestro Myth</i> and <i>Who Killed Classical Music?</i> He is also the award-winning author of the novels <i>The Song of Names</i> and <i>The Game of Opposites.</i> He writes regularly for Bloomberg.com and <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> and he presents <i>The Lebrecht Interview</i> series on BBC Radio 3 and <i>The Record Doctor</i> on WNYC. He lives in London.</p><p>The Vienna of Freud, Mahler, Mach, Wittgenstein, Schnitzler, Herzl, Trotsky, and the young Hitler forged the world we know today. It was a meeting point of individualism and collectivism, egotism and idealism, the erotic and the ascetic, the elevated and the debased. At its center whirled Gustav Mahler . . . The man and his music are central to our understanding of the course of civilization and the nature of human relationships.<br>&nbsp;<br>Art that is both high and low, original and derived, breathtaking and banal, Mahler&#x2019;s music resists textbook analysis. It is an open-ended mind game of intellectual and ironic discourse, a voyage of discovery that combines self-revelation, consolation, and renewal . . . Each symphony is a search engine for inner truths. To know Mahler is ultimately to know ourselves.</p></p><h2>Raw Art Journaling</h2><p><p><b>Meaning in life is made, not found.</b></p><p>In a raw-art journal, you don't need to know how to draw; you don't need to know how to write well.

None of the exercises require you to be an illustrator. They just require you to be willing to experiment. Because willingness and experimenting is art. <br><br>Many authors use well-known artists to contribute to the book. I used people who didn't know where to start in their journals, but jumped in anyway. I wanted the book to be in everyone's ability. I wanted to attract readers who thought, "I can do this!" and then did it.<br><br>New to art journaing? You'll find easy but intriguing exercises to get you hooked. Already an experienced journaler?

Meticulously researched, illustrated, and written with the same unmatched quality of Vansant's <i>Normandy</i> and <i>Gettysburg</i> (also from Zenith Press), <i>Bombing Nazi Germany</i> tells the story of the first and second generations of airmen, soldiers, and politicians from both sides who sought to bomb the enemy into submission. Vansant traces the development of the wildly controversial Strategic Bombing doctrine in the 1920s and 1930s, the early stages of WWII and the dominance of the German <i>Luftwaffe</i>, and the eventual 1942 involvement of the United States' 8th Air Force and its vast fleet of B-17 and B-24 bombers. Beautifully detailed with maps, schematics, and charts, <i>Bombing Nazi Germany</i> also explores how industry and science aided the Allied air forces in these violent fights, as both the Americans and British made crucial advancements in air detection and evasion methods. Finally, Vansant illustrates the lesser-known perspective of the brave German pilots five miles above the earth who fought not to protect Hitler's Reich, but their homes and families. As entertaining as it is educational, <i>Bombing Nazi Germany</i> continues Wayne Vansant&#x2019;s tradition of brilliant nonfiction graphic history.</p></p><p><i>Bombing Nazi Germany</i> profiles the dramatic and heroic story of the joint American-British Allied air war against Nazi Germany that helped end World War II in Europe.&nbsp;It profiles in beautiful art and narrative the first and second generations of airmen, soldiers, and politicians from both sides who entered battle in the air thinking that they could win the global war by bombing their enemy into submission, destroying their enemy&#x2019;s war industry, and devastating enemy morale.&nbsp;Told from the perspective of all the participants&#x2014;American, British, and German&#x2014;<i>Bombing Nazi Germany</i> delivers one of the most important campaigns of World War II in an exciting and innovative format.<p>Writer and artist <b>Wayne Vansant</b> was the primary artist for Marvel's <i>The 'Nam </i>for more than five years.

But the Modhri, an ancient telepathically linked intelligence, has walkers, unwilling hosts that can be anywhere, anything...and anyone. And Compton is the only man who knows how to fight them, as they wage a secret war against the galactic civilizations linked by the Quadrail, the only means of intra-galactic transit. <br>&nbsp;<br>Accompanied by Bayta, a woman with strange ties to the robot-like Spiders who run the Quadrail, and dogged by special agent Morse who suspects him of murder, Compton races the Modhri from station to station to acquire a set of valuable sculptures from a long-dead civilization. What the Modhri wants with them is anybody's guess, but if Compton can't outwit it, the whole galaxy will find out the hard way.</p><p>Timothy Zahn is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling and Hugo Award- winning author of more than thirty original science fiction novels and dozens of short stories. <i>Dragon and Thief</i>, in his young-adult Dragonback series, was named an ALA Best Book for Young Adults.

He lives in coastal Oregon.Chapter 1&nbsp;From the Stars&#x2019; End sector of the Filiaelian Assembly to the Darmisfar colony worlds of the Bellidosh Estates-General, the one thing everyone in the galaxy agrees on is that the best thing about traveling between the stars via Quadrail is the food. The Spiders who operate the vast system of trains and Tubes and stations have made a point of seeking out the very best recipes and cuisine from each of the twelve star-spanning civilizations and making them available for their passengers&#x2019; enjoyment. It&#x2019;s like visiting the Alien Quarter of any of a thousand cities, only you get to travel while you do it.<br>Even in the second/third-class dining cars the food was delicious, intriguing, and eclectic. Here, in first class, where it was now my privilege to ride, it was all that and more.<br>And I was ready. More than ready. I&#x2019;d suffered through a wearying twenty-day round-trip torchcruiser voyage across the Yandro system, living on ship&#x2019;s rations the whole time, followed by the much shorter fourteen-hour Quadrail ride from Yandro to Terra Station, most of which I&#x2019;d spent sleeping. Now, with a sizzling plate of artistically arranged Shorshic pili tentacles in front of me, I was finally going to get a decent meal.<br>&#x201c;Mr. Frank Compton?&#x201d;<br>I sighed. And the other thing everyone in the galaxy agrees on is that one of the greatest frustrations of Quadrail travel is some overly jovial fellow passenger interrupting you in the middle of your meal.<br>Reluctantly, I looked up. The man standing over me was Human, in his fifties, with blue eyes and white-streaked brown hair. As befit his first-class Quadrail passenger status, he was dressed in a quiet but expensive traveling suit that had been tailored within a millimeter of its life. Also as befit the average first-class passenger, he had the steady gaze and solid manner of someone used to having his every word listened to and obeyed.<br>And his expression was anything but jovial. The man was worried. Seriously worried.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m Compton,&#x201d; I confirmed. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Smith,&#x201d; he said. His voice carried a slight central EuroUnion accent. &#x201c;I wonder if I might have a moment of your time.&#x201d;<br>I glanced across the table at the dark-haired young woman seated there. Bayta had been my sort-of-informal partner for the past several months, ever since I&#x2019;d gotten myself involved in this strange twilight war between the Spiders and the group mind known as the Modhri. She was looking up at Smith, her face showing her usual wariness of strangers but nothing that might indicate she knew anything more ominous about the man. &#x201c;Fine, but only a moment,&#x201d; I told Smith. &#x201c;As you can see, we&#x2019;ve just started dinner.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My apologies for that,&#x201d; Smith said. Pulling over a chair from the unoccupied table beside us, he sat down. &#x201c;To put it bluntly, I&#x2019;m on my way into a situation that might require a man of your abilities and experience. I thought I might be able to persuade you to join me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What specific abilities and experience are you referring to?&#x201d; I asked.<br>He smiled. &#x201c;Come now, Mr. Compton, let&#x2019;s not be modest. Your record of service in Western Alliance Intelligence speaks for itself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You might possibly have missed the last page of that record,&#x201d; I suggested. &#x201c;The page where Westali summarily booted me out.&#x201d;<br>Smith snorted in a genteel sort of way. &#x201c;For your very proper attempt to alert the world to the Yandro colonization boondoggle,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Personally, I consider that a point in your favor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nice to see someone appreciates it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Unfortunately, as to your job, I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m otherwise engaged at the moment.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This would take very little of your time,&#x201d; he assured me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way to Bellis to negotiate the purchase of a small but very valuable item.&#x201d;<br>I felt my ears prick up. As it happened, Bayta and I were also on our way to Bellis, the capital world of the Bellidosh Estates-General. &#x201c;What sort of item?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A piece of artwork,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m not at liberty to say anything more right now. I assure you, though, the transaction will be completely legal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d certainly hope so,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And my part in this transaction would be . . . ?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I merely want someone competent and trustworthy at my side,&#x201d; Smith said.<br>I nodded toward his fancy suit jacket. &#x201c;It seems to me a man of your means should be able to hire carloads of extremely competent people.&#x201d;<br>His lip twitched. &#x201c;The competency part isn&#x2019;t the trick,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And you come highly recommended.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; I said, intrigued in spite of myself. There were very few people out there these days who would recommend me for any job higher than that of chief sewage handler. &#x201c;May I ask by whom?&#x201d;<br>He considered, then shrugged. &#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s not really a secret. Deputy UN Director Biret Losutu.&#x201d;<br>I looked again at Bayta, saw my own surprise reflected in her eyes. &#x201c;Interesting,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Smith agreed. &#x201c;Especially since I would have expected your part in the Yandro affair to have earned you a certain degree of hostility from him. You must be very special for his opinion to have turned around that completely.&#x201d;<br>He had that right, anyway. My whistle-blowing on the Yandro affair three years ago had made me an enemy in Losutu&#x2019;s eyes. A few months ago, when we&#x2019;d next met, that status had eroded to the point where I merely qualified as an irritant.<br>But that was before Losutu himself had been dragged into this quiet war.<br>The fact that Smith had dropped Losutu&#x2019;s name made this a shade more intriguing. Unfortunately, there was no way of knowing whether or not he was telling the truth about Losutu having recommended me to him.<br>Even if he was, there was the whole question of whether I was willing to trust either of them. &#x201c;You and Director Losutu are very kind,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But as I said, I&#x2019;m otherwise engaged.&#x201d; I picked up my fork, trusting Smith would take the hint.<br>He didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Mr. Compton, let me put my cards on the table,&#x201d; he said, making no move to get up. &#x201c;I postponed my trip to Bellis in hopes of linking up with you. In fact, I ended up staying on Terra Station for an extra six hours waiting for you to get back from wherever it was you were.&#x201d;<br>I eyed him closely, the hairs at the back of my neck doing a gentle tingle. I had in fact been almost exactly six hours off my original timetable in returning to Terra Station, a timetable Losutu was very much aware of. That part, at least, checked out.<br>Problem was, Losutu wasn&#x2019;t the only one who would have known the timing on that mission. &#x201c;Sorry for the inconvenience,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Oh, I wasn&#x2019;t blaming you,&#x201d; Smith hastened to assure me. &#x201c;I was simply pointing out that the delay made the whole thing a bit more awkward. Especially since Losutu wouldn&#x2019;t tell me where you were coming in from, but only when you were expected back. That meant I had to keep an eye on every incoming train.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky you found me at all,&#x201d; I said. If, of course, it had been luck.<br>&#x201c;Yes, indeed.&#x201d; He nodded to Bayta. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d just spotted you and your lovely companion and was on my way to talk to you when you got up and headed to the platform for this train. I was barely able to get a reservation in time to make it aboard myself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re obviously a very lucky man,&#x201d; I commented.<br>&#x201c;In my experience, luck comes to those who don&#x2019;t rely on it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The point is that I want your help.&#x201d; He raised his eyebrows slightly. &#x201c;And as you suggested earlier, money&#x2019;s no object.&#x201d;<br>There it was: the end point I&#x2019;d been waiting for. Eventually, if you waited long enough, it always came down to money. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s not,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But as I said, we&#x2019;re busy.&#x201d;<br>For a moment he studied my face. &#x201c;May I at least ask you to think it over?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Feel free to drop by my compartment if you&#x2019;d like more details.&#x201d; He glanced around. &#x201c;With more privacy, I can be a bit more open.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; I said noncommittally.<br>&#x201c;Please do,&#x201d; he said, finally standing up. &#x201c;Compartment eleven. Drop in anytime.&#x201d;<br>With another nod at Bayta, he returned his chair to the other table and made his way through the room to the corridor bordering the dining area. Turning left, he disappeared toward the first-class car in front of us and the compartment car beyond that. &#x201c;His compartment&#x2019;s right across from yours,&#x201d; I commented to Bayta, finally slicing off a piece of pili. &#x201c;Handy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wonder if that&#x2019;s a coincidence,&#x201d; she said, scooping up a bite of her own meal. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;About Smith? Or about Smith&#x2019;s offer?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Either. Both.&#x201d;<br>I shrugged. &#x201c;He personally is probably legit. His little transaction is more doubtful. Either way, it&#x2019;s kind of irrelevant.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she countered. &#x201c;If it is a genuine offer, it might be a good cover for us.&#x201d;<br>I took another bite, mulling it over. She had a point. The Modhri homeland had been destroyed, but the Modhri himself was unfortunately still very much alive.<br>It was, without a doubt, the most bizarre enemy anyone had ever faced. The Modhri was technically a single entity, a group mind composed of the telepathically linked polyps that lived in the decorative and highly prized Modhran coral. He&#x2019;d been created as a last-ditch weapon of the Shonkla-raa, a vicious race of conquerors, during the last stages of a revolt that had wiped them out sixteen hundred years ago.<br>Unfortunately, the Shonkla-raa&#x2019;s little fifth column weapon hadn&#x2019;t died with them. The Modhri had remained dormant for centuries, until the coral had been rediscovered and the Modhri inadvertently unleashed on the galaxy. Before the Spiders and their secretive Chahwyn masters had finally tumbled to his existence, he&#x2019;d gotten his claws firmly planted in the power centers of most of the Twelve Empires served by the Quadrail system.<br>The presence of an aggressive group mind hidden in clumps of coral would have been bad enough. What made the whole thing infinitely worse was that the polyps could also invade and live inside living beings: Humans and Bellidos and Juriani and pretty much everyone else in the galaxy. A polyp hook could move in with just a scratch of the coral and reproduce enough polyps inside their host to create a new Modhri mind segment.<br>In some ways it was like the terrorist wars of the early century. Only worse, because the newly created walker was completely unaware of the fact that he or she had been co-opted into the Modhri&#x2019;s quiet war of conquest. Most of the time the colony lay quiet, occasionally making subtle mental suggestions that the host would usually obey and afterward find a reason to rationalize away.<br>But that was under normal circumstances. Under more urgent need, the Modhri mind segment could take complete control of his host, overriding the resident mind and turning the body into a sort of life-sized marionette. The host would have no memory of that period, but would merely end up with a strange blacked-out chunk of his or her day.<br>Even then, if the Modhri was clever, he could avoid suspicion. A short blackout could be rationalized in any number of ways, especially if the walker was accustomed to drinking intoxicants. Since most of the rich and influential who were the Modhri&#x2019;s targets of choice had learned social drinking at an early age, it was an easy and obvious explanation for the Modhri to push.<br>If that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, each walker mind segment could also telepathically link up with the segments of other nearby walkers, or with outposts of the coral itself, creating a larger, smarter, more dangerous mind. A given Modhri mind segment was never static, but continually added pieces and information to itself as new walkers came into telepathic range and losing pieces as old ones moved away off the edge of its consciousness. The result was a fluid, ever-changing opponent that was as hard to pin down as a drop of mercury.<br>Fortunately, even slippery enemies weren&#x2019;t infallible. One of our few allies in this war, a rogue Belldic commando squad leader named Korak Fayr, had taken upon himself the goal of ridding his own worlds of Modhran influence. To that end, he&#x2019;d spent the last few months moving around the Bellidosh Estates-General, destroying every coral outpost he could get his hands on.<br>The Modhri had spent those same months trying his damnedest to find Fayr and throw a rope around him. Making Fayr&#x2019;s job all the more difficult was the fact that the high monetary value of the coral meant that even owners and police who weren&#x2019;t carrying Modhran colonies under their skins were trying to nail him to the wall.<br>Fayr was the sort who enjoyed a challenge. Still, I doubted he would turn down any reasonable offer of assistance, which was why Bayta and I were on our way to Bellis to offer him some.<br>Which brought me back to Bayta&#x2019;s question. The Modhri was undoubtedly still looking for us, and might have a few walkers hanging around the transfer station where Quadrail passengers bound for the Bellis inner system went through customs. If Mr. Smith&#x2019;s mysterious errand could provide Bayta and me with a legitimate reason to enter Belldic space, it might be worth a few days of our time to accommodate him.<br>The problem was the other side of coin . . . because if Smith himself was a Modhran walker, then no matter how legitimate he might think his offer, going with him would probably walk us straight into a trap.<br>Up to now the Modhri hadn&#x2019;t shown himself to be a particularly vengeful sort. But that was before we&#x2019;d destroyed his homeland. I wasn&#x2019;t eager to find out what his new attitude toward us might be. &#x201c;Forget it,&#x201d; I told Bayta. &#x201c;Not worth the risk.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not interested,&#x201d; I said firmly, cutting off another bite.<br>&#x201c;Maybe we aren&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Bayta said, a little crossly. &#x201c;But someone else is.&#x201d;<br>I knew better than to abruptly stop what I was doing and spin around. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; I asked, putting the pili into my mouth.<br>Her eyes flicked over my shoulder, then returned to her own plate. &#x201c;There are two of them: a man and a woman,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The man&#x2019;s about your age, the woman about the same age as Mr. Smith.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s their meal going?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think they&#x2019;re almost finished,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But the man was definitely watching your conversation with Mr. Smith.&#x201d;<br>And watching was pretty much all he could do at that distance. The acoustics in Quadrail dining and bar cars were designed to make eavesdropping from more than about a meter away effectively impossible. &#x201c;Let me know when they get ready to leave,&#x201d; I said.<br>I got three more bites of pili and had tried the accompanying cornleaf mash when Bayta murmured her warning. I looked down into my lap, pretending to adjust my napkin, and was gazing at the floor as they walked past.<br>Their shoes were the first items up for consideration. The woman&#x2019;s were very much upper class, while the man&#x2019;s were nice but nothing special. I let my eyes move upward as the two of them continued by, giving each article of clothing the same quick analysis, then checked out the backs of their heads and their hairstyles.<br>There was no doubt about it. The woman belonged here among the stratospheric wealthy of the galaxy. The man was jus...</p><h2>Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-lived, Joyful Life (ALFRED A.

He's lived a hundred lives. He was a hoodlum in Ukraine, an idol of the Soviet underground, punk-poet and valet to a billionaire in Manhattan, fashion writer in Paris, lost soldier in the Balkans, and now, in the chaos after the fall of communism a charismatic party leader of a gang of political desperados. Limonov sees himself as a hero, but he is also a bastard. Carrere suspends judgment.

His &#34;non-fiction novel&#34;, Limonov, has two explicit modes - part adventure story, part cultural-historical analysis ... it is about Carrere&#39;s exploration of himself, his Russian heritage, and what it means to be a European after the second world war, especially since the end of the cold war -- Robert McCrum * Observer * I loved Limonov by Emmanuel Carrere, which happens to be a book about a Russian guy.

Graceful and important -- John Freeman * NPR * You might not have heard of [Limonov], and after you have read this you might wish you had not heard of him, but you will certainly have enjoyed reading about his life, thanks to the verve of Emmanuel Carrere&#39;s exhilarating narration. You will probably also understand considerably more about the country that produced such a narcissistic and controversial figure, whom the author finds alluring and repellent in equal measure . . . Carrere has seized on Limonov&#39;s projection of himself as a literary hero (or anti-hero) straight out of the pages of Dostoyevsky, Celine, or Henry Miller, and run with it -- Rosamund Bartlett * Independent * This is an extraordinary, fantastic book about an extraordinary, fantastic life. It&#39;s billed as a novel, can be read as a novel and would be a good novel if Eduard Limonov had never existed. But he does . . . you will learn an awful lot about Russia now and in the days of the Soviets -- Allan Massie * Scotsman * Russia, they say, cannot be understood with the mind alone, and neither can her looniest son to date, Edichka Limonov.

In it, five Frenchmen go off to war, two of them leaving behind a young woman who longs for their return. But the main character in this brilliant novel is the Great War itself. Echenoz, whose work has been compared to that of writers as diverse as Joseph Conrad and Laurence Sterne, leads us gently from a balmy summer day deep into the relentless and, one hundred years later, still unthinkable carnage of trench warfare.<br><br>With the delicacy of a miniaturist and with an irony that is both witty and clear-eyed, Echenoz offers us an intimate epic: in the panorama of a clear blue sky, a bi-plane spirals suddenly into the ground; a piece of shrapnel shears the top off a man&#x2019;s head as if it were a soft-boiled egg; we dawdle dreamily in a spring-scented clearing with a lonely shell-shocked soldier strolling innocently toward a firing squad ready to shoot him for desertion.<br><br>Ultimately, the grace notes of humanity in <i>1914</i> rise above the terrors of war in this beautifully crafted tale that Echenoz tells with discretion, precision, and love.<br></p><p><b>Jean Echenoz</b> won France&#x2019;s prestigious Prix Goncourt for <i>I&#x2019;m Gone </i>(The New Press).

Install one and your dog can go outside whenever he wishes with nary a lift of a nger from you. But don&#x2019;t even consider installing a dog door to the outdoors if you don&#x2019;t have a securely fenced-in yard. To avoid the potential for someone opening the gate in your yard and unintentionally letting your dog loose, locked gates are also a must.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p>One of your biggest decisions when faced with the plethora of dog door styles will be choosing between the electronic and the manual dog door. If cost is a factor, you&#x2019;re going to lean toward the manual; if security is your greatest concern, then your best bet is the electronic door. The electronic door is made of hard plastic or Plexiglas, and it responds to an infrared signal from a key attached to the dog&#x2019;s collar. It can emit a hum when activated, which is disconcerting to some dogs at rst. When shopping for an electronic dog door, pay attention to the specs; some electronic doors open in only one direction.</p> <p><b></b></p><b>the specs; some electronic doors open in only one direction. Some dogs will go through the door right away without a problem, but most need to have so</b><p></p> <p>Before you install the ap, take the one item that is most irresistible to your dog and go to the other side of the door. Slowly wave the goody just under your dog&#x2019;s nose and lure him toward you through the door. Give your dog the come command in a cheerful and encouraging manner. Once your dog is stepping through the dog door like it&#x2019;s no big deal, install the ap. Go to the side of the door opposite your dog, pull the ap toward you just a bit, and lure your dog as you did when the door was wide open. Do this a few times so your dog gets used to the feel of the ap against his body, then just call your dog to go through the door, ap and all.

Measure a dog&#x2019;s breadth across the shoulders and depth between shoulder and bottom of rib cage. Center the template that comes with the pet door on the lower middle of the human door. The ideal height of a dog door top is about 2" above the standing dog&#x2019;s shoulders. For structural reasons, the cutout should not fall below 3" from the bottom of the human door.

Next, drill starter holes just inside the corners of the cutout rectangle for the jigsaw blade. If the door is metal, pound a dimple into the surface at each hole location with a nail, and then drill through with progressively larger bits until you can fit your saw blade through. Cut along the side and bottom cutout lines with a jigsaw. Cut the top side last. Tape the cutout in the door as you go to support it, and to keep it from splintering or tearing.</p> <p><b></b></p><b>Step 3</b><p></p> <p>f the pet door straddles a rail and a recessed panel or panels, you&#x2019;ll need to even out the opening so the door has a flat installation surface.

Over that time he would share the loneliness, incredible workload, camaraderie, and discomfort of the crew, and would get a close look at the complicated business of high-tech warfare. He would see how military force can work well, and how it can go wrong. Wilson interviewed hundreds of knowledgeable people, from the Secretary of the Navy down. He was aboard for the air strikes against Syrian and Lebanese targets in which some of the Kennedy's planes and crew were lost, and he discusses how the chain of command, from the White House to the squadron, handled the raids.

Bequeathed to the National Trust, these homes have mostly survived and now serve as a glimpse into bygone eras. An introductory chapter focuses on the history of the National Trust and its policy to preserve, restore, interpret, and present these magnificent homes to the public. Each of the five remaining chapters surveys a different style and period of building spanning the years 1250 to 1930. The striking illustrations successfully blend exterior and interior photographs, sketches, designs, paintings, and watercolors, and a gazetteer of National Trust historic houses with brief descriptions and bibliographic references concludes the text. The endpapers are maps showing the location of these National Trust homes in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales.

His most recent release is The Longest Ride</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Nicholas Sparks: </strong>We first met years ago, when <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> and <i>The Notebook</i> were just out. What&#x2019;s been the most surprising turn for your career since that day?</p> <p><strong>Mitch Albom:</strong> Pretty much everything. <i>Tuesdays</i> was the first nonsports thing I had done, and it was written only to pay Morrie&#x2019;s medical bills. I figured I&#x2019;d return to sportswriting. I never imagined novels or the audience I&#x2019;ve been blessed to find. I remember you hoping <i>The Notebook</i> would give you more chances to write. I think you&#x2019;ve done OK with that, by the way.</p> <p><strong>NS: </strong>Thanks. With this new novel, The <i>First Phone Call from Heaven</i>, heaven once again figures prominently&#x2014;as it did in <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i>. How do you use it differently this time?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> <i>Five People</i> mostly takes place in heaven, to teach Eddie, the protagonist, to appreciate his life on earth. <i>First Phone Call</i> takes place in a small town, with the idea of heaven reaching out to us down here&#x2014;through the phone.</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> You wove the story of Alexander Graham Bell&#x2019;s invention of the telephone into this novel. Do you see parallels between that and our modern-day obsession with cell phones? How did this influence your story development?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> People scoffed at the telephone&#x2019;s invention. Yet once it was introduced, its growth was astronomical. Same thing with cell phones. I used this to show how the &#x201c;once impossible&#x201d; is quickly forgotten. Could the same be true about speaking to heaven?</p> <p><strong>NS: </strong>Hearing from a deceased loved one is such a powerful idea. Whom would you talk to if you had the chance? And if Morrie from <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> were one, what would you ask him? </p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> My mother is still alive, but has suffered several strokes and can&#x2019;t speak. I wish I could dial to the past and engage in one of our long, impassioned, all-over-the-place talks. And Morrie? Well. He never got to read a page of <i>Tuesdays</i>. I&#x2019;d ask if he is pleased. Am I doing OK by him? Mostly, I&#x2019;d like to hear his laughter. I think we miss laughter most. </p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> This is the first novel you&#x2019;ve written with a mystery/thriller element. Did that change your writing process at all? And is this how you think the world would really react&#x2014;global fascination&#x2014;if proof of heaven were somehow revealed?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> It felt quite natural to weave a mystery&#x2014;perhaps from all those years&#x2019; writing sports that count down and reach a climax. And yes, I definitely think if a town today claimed to be talking to heaven, it would be on twenty-four hours a day on cable news and the Internet. Look at the Susan Boyle story. In a week, the whole world knew of her&#x2014;and she just sang like an angel. Imagine talking to one!</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> Small towns&#x2014;like Coldwater in <i>First Phone Call</i>&#x2014;often paint the backdrop of your novels. Why?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> I was raised in a small town&#x2014;local high school, one great pizza place, everyone knowing everyone. So it&#x2019;s familiar. Also, secrets in a small town are hard to keep&#x2014;and often shocking when revealed. My stories are about people&#x2014;and sometimes secrets. A small town is a good canvas.</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> Now that you have so many more books than just <i>Morrie</i>&#x2014;unlike when we first met&#x2014;do you have a favorite among them?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> <i>Tuesdays</i> will always be my favored child&#x2014;because it so changed my life. But storywise, <i>Five People</i> means a great deal, because everyone told me I was crazy&#x2014;don&#x2019;t write a novel. I broke every piece of advice. And people embraced the story. That&#x2019;s extremely rewarding.</p><p><em>"What if the end is not the end?" </em></p><p>From the beloved author of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em> and <em>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</em> comes his most thrilling and magical novel yet&#x2014;a page-turning mystery and a meditation on the power of human connection.</p><p>One morning in the small town of Coldwater, Michigan, the phones start ringing.

"I still wanted to be a writer; I always wanted to be a writer, but I had to pay the bills, so I went to work in the theater," she says.<br><br>Touring as an actress seems to have been a catalyst for her. She wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain,</i> while touring with Eva Le Gallienne in <i>Uncle Harry</i>. She met Hugh Franklin, to whom she was married until his death in 1986, while they were rehearsing <i>The Cherry Orchard,</i> and they were married on tour during a run of <i>The Joyous Season,</i> starring Ethel Barrymore.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle retired from the stage after her marriage, and the Franklins moved to northwest Connecticut and opened a general store. "The surrounding area was real dairy farmland then, and very rural. Some of the children had never seen books when they began their first year of school," she remembers. The Franklins raised three children--Josephine, Maria, and Bion. Ms. L'Engle's first book in the Austin quintet, <i>Meet the Austins,</i> an ALA Notable Children's Book, has strong parallels with her life in the country. But she says, "I identify with Vicky rather than with Mrs. Austin, since I share all of Vicky's insecurities, enthusiasms, and times of sadness and growth."<br><br>When, after a decade in Connecticut, the family returned to New York, Ms. L'Engle rejoiced. "In some ways, I was back in the real world." Mr. Franklin resumed acting, and became well known as Dr. Charles Tyler in the television series <i>All My Children.</i> <i>Two-Part Invention</i> is Ms. L'Engle's touching and critically acclaimed story of their long and loving marriage. <br><br>The Time quintet--<i>A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters,</i> and <i>An Acceptable Time</i>--are among her most famous books, but it took years to get a publisher to accept <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i> "Every major publisher turned it down. No one knew what to do with it," she says. When Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux finally accepted the manuscript, she insisted that they publish it as a children's book. It was the beginning of their children's list."<br><br>Today, Ms. L'Engle lives in New York City and Connecticut, writing at home and at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, where she is variously the librarian and the writer-in-residence. "It depends from day-to-day on what they want to call me. I do keep the library collection--largely theology, philosophy, a lot of good reference books--open on a volunteer basis."<br><b>Author Fun Facts<br><br></b><i>Born<br></i>November 29 in New York City<br><br><i>Education<br></i>Smith College, The New School, Columbia University<br><br><i>Currently lives<br></i>New York City and Connecticut<br><br><i>Fun Jobs<br></i>Librarian, actress<br><br><i>Favorite...<br></i>...hobbies: traveling, reading, playing the piano, and cooking<br><b>A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle<br><br>"</b>I wrote my first story when I was 5. It was about a little G-R-U-L, because that&#x2019;s how I spelled &#x201c;girl&#x201d; when I was 5. I wrote because I wanted to know what everything was about. My father, before I was born, had been gassed in the first World War, and I wanted to know why there wer wars, why people hurt each other, why we couldn&#x2019;t get along together, and what made people tick. That&#x2019;s why I started to write stories.<br><br>The books I read most as a child were by Lucy Maud Montgomery, who&#x2019;s best known for her Anne of Green Gables stories, but I also liked Emily of New Moon. Emily was an only child, as I was. Emily lived on an island, as did I. Although Manhattan Island and Prince Edward Island are not very much alike, they are still islands. Emily&#x2019;s father was dying of bad lungs, and so was mine. Emily had some dreadful relative, and so did I. She had a hard time in school, and she also understood that there&#x2019;s more to life than just the things that can be explained by encyclopedias and facts. Facts alone are not adequate. I love Emily. I also read E. Nesbit, who was a nineteenth-century writer of fantasies and family stories, and I read fairy tales and the myths of all countries. And anything I could get my hands on.<br><br>As an adult, I like to read fiction. I really enjoy good murder mystery writers, usually women, frequently English, because they have a sense of what the human soul is about and why people do dark and terrible things. I also read quite a lot in the area of particle physics and quantum mechanics, because this is theology. This is about the nature of being. This is what life is all about. I try to read as widely as I possibly can.<br><br>I wrote <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> when we were living in a small dairy farm village in New England. I had three small children to raise, and life was not easy. We lost four of our closest friends within two years by death--that&#x2019;s a lot of death statistically. And I really wasn&#x2019;t finding the answers to my big questions in the logical places. So, at the time I discovered the world of particle physics. I discovered Einstein and relativity. I read a book of Einstein&#x2019;s, in which he said that anyone who&#x2019;s not lost in rapturous awe at the power and glory of the mind behind the universe is as good as a burnt-out candle. And I thought, &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve found my theologian, what a wonderful thing.&#x201d; I began to read more in that area. <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> came out of these questions, and out of my discovery of the post-utopian sciences, which knocked everything we knew about science for a loop.<br><br><i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was almost never published. You can&#x2019;t name a major publisher who didn&#x2019;t reject it. And there were many reasons. One was that it was supposedly too hard for children. Well, my children were 7, 10, and 12 while I was writing it. I&#x2019;d read to them at night what I&#x2019;d written during the day, and they&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Ooh, mother, go back to the typewriter!&#x201d; <i>A Wrinkle in Time&#x201d; </i>had a female protagonist in a science fiction book, and that wasn&#x2019;t done. And it dealt with evil and things that you don&#x2019;t find, or didn&#x2019;t at that time, in children&#x2019;s books. When we&#x2019;d run through forty-odd publishers, my agent sent it back. We gave up. Then my mother was visiting for Christmas, and I gave her a tea party for some of her old friends. One of them happened to belong to a small writing group run by John Farrar, of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, which at that time did not have a juvenile list. She insisted that I meet John any how, and I went down with my battered manuscript. John had read my first novel and liked it, and read this book and loved it. That&#x2019;s how it happened.<br><br>The most asked question that I generally receive is, &#x201c;Where do you get your ideas?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s very easily answered. I tell a story about Johann Sebastian Bach when he was an old man. A student asked him, &#x201c;Papa Bach, where do you get the ideas for all of these melodies?&#x201d; And the old man said, &#x201c;Why, when I get up in the morning, it&#x2019;s all I can do not to trip over them.&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s how ideas are; they&#x2019;re just everywhere. I think the least asked question is one that I got in Japan. This little girl held up her hand and said, &#x201c;How tall are you?&#x201d; In Japan, I am very tall.<br><br>I get over one hundred letters a week. There are always letters that stand out. There was one from a 12-year-old girl in North Carolina who wrote me many years ago, saying &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jewish and most of my friends are Christian. My Christian friends told me only Christians can be saved. What do you think? Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d; Well, we corresponded for about twenty years. I suggested that she go back to read some of the great Jewish writers to find out about her own tradition. Another letter asked, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re studying the crusades in school. Can there be such a thing as a Holy War? Is war ever right?&#x201d; I mean, kids don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask questions. And it&#x2019;s a great honor to have the kids say, &#x201c;Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d;<br><br>The questions are not always about the books. They&#x2019;re sometimes about the deepest issues of life. &#x201c;Why did my parents put my grandmother in a nursing home?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s one that has come up several times. The letters are enlightening, particularly when they are...</p><h2>God&#39;s Funeral: The Decline of Faith in Western Civilization</h2><p>A magisterial, colorful narrative illuminates the central tragedy of the nineteenth century--that God, or rather man&#39;s faith in God, died, but the need to worship remained as a torment to those who thought they had buried Him. Tour.</p><p><i>God's Funeral</i> is A.N. Wilson's account of the decline of orthodox Christianity in Victorian Britain. The most popular explanation for this widely-recognized phenomenon is the acceptance by intellectuals of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. To disprove the notion that Darwin singlehandedly committed deicide, Wilson describes a host of secularizing predecessors and accomplices such as Hume, Gibbon, John Stuart Mill, Hegel, Marx, and Carlyle. All play major roles in Wilson's brilliantly staged reconstruction of the so-called death of God. <i>God's Funeral</i> also takes account of the pain and confusion these intellectuals brought upon themselves when their great achievements helped erode the social and intellectual foundations of their lives. Furthermore, Wilson shows how their crises of faith relate to our own. Like our Victorian forebears, contemporary readers still must ask, "Is our personal religion that which links us to the ultimate reality, or is it the final human fantasy...?" and, "Is there a world of value outside ourselves, or do we, collectively and individually, invent what we call The Good?" <i>God's Funeral</i> helps readers learn to ask these questions in smarter and sharper ways by giving them a clearer sense of how Western society reached its current state of confusion.At the end of the 19th century, Christian theologian Ernst Troeltsch proclaimed that the sun was setting on Christianity, and poet Matthew Arnold declared that in the future poetry would replace religion. As Wilson (The Vicar of Sorrows) points out in this splendid book, the 19th century provided the context not only for theories of God's demise but also for the numerous challenges that political thinkers, scientists and artists posed to Christian belief. Yet, as he notes, while the battles between faith and doubt were raging, church attendance did not decline but remained constant. The famous debates between Thomas Huxley, Darwin's "bulldog," and Bishop Wilberforce contributed to an atmosphere of optimism about the perfectibility of humankind and the world. Wilson traces the development of this rise of unbelief from the 18th century to the early 20th century. He contends that Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, with its contempt of Christianity's "highest ideals," and David Hume's skeptical Dialogues Concerning National Religion, which challenges the very possibility of the existence of the supernatural, provide the groundwork for the demise of belief in the 19th century. Wilson explores some of the most explicit instances of the century's intellectual challenges to faith: George Eliot's translations of Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity and David Friedrich Strauss's The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined; Darwin's evolutionary formulations calling into question the idea of a special creation; Marx and Engels's charge that bourgeois institutions used religion to enslave people and make them weak; William James's reading of various religious states in The Varieties of Religious Experience as psychological states of mind. Eliot's translations alone introduced into England both Strauss's contentions that the life of Jesus was clothed in myth pictures like the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection and Feuerbach's claim that God was nothing more than a projection of humanity's wishes. Wilson examines also how the Catholic Church responded to the Modernist thought of Alfred Loisy, who imported much of the skepticism of the 19th century into his religious writings and challenged conventional Catholic teachings on the Church and the Bible. With passionate prose and a lively style, Wilson narrates a first-rate intellectual and religious history. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>LANDSCAPE PAINTING with Gary Jenkins</h2><p>By Gary Jenkins.

His bricklaying is a little rusty, but passable as he checks out the foreman who's under suspicion. A crane operator has disappeared--along with some heavy machinery. But when a well-orchestrated riot causes the foreman's "accidental" death, Smith plunges into a morass of bribery, blackmail and blood looking for answers. With the help of his Chinese-American partner Lydia Chin, he follows a trail of twisted loyalties, old-fashioned greed and organized crime to its heart-stopping conclusion. Murder--with no end in sight. </p><p>S.J. Rozan won the 1998 Anthony Award for <i>No Colder Place</i>.</p></p><p>S. J. Rozan is a New York architect who knows how to design a fine mystery novel: by doing her homework, using the best quality materials, and keeping the surprises coming until the very end. In her fourth book about unlikely detective partners Lydia Chin and Bill Smith, Rozan plants Smith high up in the clouds, laying brick on a troubled building site while Chin gets a job as a secretary in the construction bosses' trailer. Both see plenty of action, as what at first appears to be a simple case of a few crooked construction workers becomes a much more complicated story of twisted family relationships.

Along with serving and presentation suggestions, substitutions where appropriate, and a host of other culinary tips and advice, <b>The Cafe Flora Cookbook</b> embodies the true genius of this inventive restaurant.</p><p></p></p><p>Catherine Geier, who became the Executive Chef at Cafe Flora in Seattle in 1995, is now the head of special projects and publications. She is also a chef and Director of Food Services for the Tierra Learning Center, a 320-acre retreat in the Cascade Mountains of Washington state.Seattle's popular vegetarian restaurant shares its recipes with fans of meatless cooking. What sets this book apart from so many other vegetarian cookbooks is its attempt to take this branch of cookery beyond the usual melange of steamed and stewed greens into more decidedly haute cuisine. Portobello Wellington lacks the beef and foie gras of the parent dish, but its accompanying sophisticated Madeira sauce marks it as more complex than just mushroom-stuffed pastry. For a stunning brunch dish, Geier turns a quesadilla inside out, coating the potato and cheese-stuffed tortilla with a layer of scrambled eggs. Goan curry uses chickpeas and a welter of freshly toasted spices and homemade vindaloo paste to achieve its effect. A welter of pizza recipes shows how adaptable basic pizza can be to a host of different interpretations, some savory, others sweet. Many recipes, specially marked, satisfy vegan requirements; but dairy products and eggs abound throughout most dishes. Meat substitutes such as seitan appear only rarely. Oddly enough, there are no dessert recipes. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Reprint.</p><p>British diplomat Justin Quayle, complacent raiser of freesias and doting husband of the stunning, much younger Tessa, has tended his own garden in Nairobi too long. Tessa is Justin's opposite, a fiery reformer, "that rarest thing, a lawyer who believes in justice," whose campaigns have earned her a nickname: "the Princess Diana of the African poor." But now Tessa has turned up naked, raped, and dead on a mysterious visit to remote Lake Turkana in Kenya. Her traveling companion (and lover?), the handsome Congolese-Belgian doctor Arnold Bluhm, has vanished. So has Quayle's complacency. <p> Tessa had been compiling data against a multinational drug company that uses helpless Africans as guinea pigs to test a tuberculosis remedy with unfortunately fatal side effects. Her report was destroyed by her husband's superiors; was she? It's all somehow connected to the sinister British firm House of ThreeBees, whose ad boasts that it's "buzzy for the health of Africa!" John le Carr� symbolically associates ThreeBees with an ominous buzz in the Nairobi morgue: "Over [the corpses], in a swaying, muddy mist, hung the flies, snoring on a single note."</p><p> The home office tries to take Quayle in out of the cold. He cleverly eludes their clammy embrace, turns spy, and takes off on a global chase to avenge Tessa and solve her murder. Le Carr� has lost none of his gift for setting vivid scenes in far-flung places expertly described: London, Germany, Saskatchewan, Kenya. His sprinting thriller prose remains in great shape. And thanks to his 16 years in the British Foreign Office, his merciless send-up of its cutthroat intrigues and petty self-delusions is unbelievably good--or rather, believably so. This is global do-gooder satire on a literary par with Doris Lessing's <i>The Summer Before the Dark</i>.</p><p> But you want to know if <i>The Constant Gardener</i> is as good as <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>. Very nearly. Africa's nightmare is more complex than the cold war chess match, and the world pharmaceutical circus is tougher to dramatize than the old spy-versus-spy-versus-spymaster game. Still, le Carr� can write a smart, melancholy page-turner, and his moral outrage (the real subject of his books) burns as brightly as ever. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>John le Carr�</b> was born in 1931.

This collaboration first began when Katra helped Targ miraculously cure himself of metastatic cancer. Skeptics will probably find themselves impressed by the thoroughness of Targ's research as well as his highly plausible conclusions. For example, Targ reveals for the first time the startling results of declassified CIA experiments in psychic spying during the Cold War. Believers in spiritual healing will find support in Katra's impressive credentials and rich storytelling. The authors share a gift for engaging but spare prose, which makes for highly palatable reading, despite the density of ideas and information. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><h2>Chemistry &amp; Chemical Reactivity AP Edition</h2><p>Chemistry &amp; Chemical Reactivity AP Edition</p><p></p><h2>Sitting Bull: Champion of the Sioux (Volume 46) (The Civilization of the American Indian Series)</h2><p><p>"If that is Long Hair, I am the one who killed him," White Bull, the young nephew of Sitting Bull, said when Bad Juice pointed out Custer's body immediately after the Battle of the Little Big Horn.

Nate Callahan grinned and drew her closer. There were few things in life more enjoyable than making love to a beautiful woman. </p><p> "Oh, absolutely." Cuddling up against him, she fluttered her lashes in a way only a true southern belle could pull off. "Why, a Libra man can charm the birds out of the trees and flatter a girl right out of her lace panties." </p><p> "It wasn't flattery, <i>ch�re</i>." He refilled her crystal champagne flute. "It was the absolute truth." </p><p> Nate had always enjoyed females -- he liked the way they moved, the way they smelled, their soft skin and slender ladies' hands. From the first time he'd filched one of his older brother Finn's <i>Playboy</i> magazines, he'd flat-out liked everything about women. Fortunately, they'd always liked him right back. </p><p> He toyed with a blond curl trailing down her neck. It was a little stiff and hadn't deflated much during their session of hot, steamy sex, but Nate was used to that, since most of the women he dated favored big hair. Big hair, big breasts, and, he thought with a pleasant twinge of lust, big appetites for sex. </p><p> "Your moon is in the seventh house." She trailed a glossy coral nail down his chest. </p><p> "Is that good?" He skimmed his palm down her back; she arched against the caress like a sleek, pampered cat. </p><p> Outside her bedroom, a full moon rose in a star-studded sky; inside, flames crackled cozily in the fireplace and gardenia-scented candles glowed. </p><p> "It certainly is. You're ruled by Venus, goddess of beauty." </p><p> "Seems that'd fit you better than me, sugar." He nuzzled the smooth curve of her shoulder. His accent, always more pronounced when romancing a woman, turned thick as Cajun gumbo. "Bein' how you've gotten more beautiful every year since you won that Miss Louisiana crown." </p><p> "I was only first runner-up." She pouted prettily. </p><p> "Officially," he allowed. "But everyone in the state knew the judges were obviously blind as swamp bats." </p><p> "You are so sweet." Her laugh was rich and pleased. </p><p> Nate's mind began to drift as she chattered on about the stars, which, if he were to be perfectly honest, didn't interest him. He'd never thought much about lunar signs until the afternoon he'd shown up to give the blond astrologer a bid on remodeling her bedroom. </p><p> Although he'd arrived ten minutes late at her Garden District house, he'd gotten her out of the shower; she'd shown up at the door, breathlessly apologetic for not being ready, prettily flushed, and smelling of jasmine. It was only later, when he'd remembered that her hair hadn't been wet, that Nate realized he'd been set up. Having always appreciated female wiles, he didn't mind. </p><p> She'd hung on to his every word as he'd suggested ways to open up the room -- including putting a skylight over the bed -- declared him brilliant, and hired him on the spot. </p><p> "You are," she'd sworn on a drawl as sweet as the sugarcane his granddaddy used to grow, "the first contractor I've interviewed who understands that a bedroom is more than just a place to sleep." She'd coyly looked up at him from beneath her lashes. "It is, after all, the most important room in the house." </p><p> When she'd touched a scarlet fingernail to the back of Nate's hand, warm and pleasant desire had ribboned through him. </p><p> "You've been so sweet. Would you do me just one teensy little favor?" </p><p> "Sure, <i>ch�re</i>. If I can." </p><p> Avid green eyes had swept over him in a slow, feminine perusal. "Oh, I think you're just the man for the job." </p><p> She'd untied the silk robe, revealing perfumed and powdered flesh. "I do so need to exorcise my horrid ex-husband's memory from this room." The robe dropped to the plush carpeting. </p><p> That had been six months ago. Not only had Nate done his best to exorcise her former husband's memory, he'd done a damn fine job on the remodeling, if he did say so himself. Lying on his back amid sex-tangled sheets, Nate looked up at the ghost galleon moon, decided he'd definitely been right about the skylight, and wondered why he'd never thought to put one over his own bed. </p><p> "Of course, Venus is also the goddess of love." The L word, slipping smoothly from her coral-tinted lips, yanked his wandering mind back to their conversation. </p><p> "She is?" he asked with a bit more caution. </p><p> "Absolutely. Make love, not war, is a phrase that could have been coined with Libras in mind. You became interested in women at a young age, you make sex a rewarding experience, and will not stop until your lover is satisfied, even if it takes all night." </p><p> "I try," he said modestly. She'd certainly seemed well satisfied when she'd been bucking beneath him earlier. </p><p> She smiled and touched her lips to his. "Oh, you not only succeed, darling, you set the standard. Libras also rule the house of partnerships." </p><p> "Now there's where your stars might be a little off, sugar." He stroked her smooth silk back, cupped her butt, and pulled her closer. " 'Cause I've always enjoyed working alone." </p><p> It wasn't that he was antisocial, far from it. But he liked being his own boss, working when he liked, and playing when he wanted. </p><p> "You weren't alone a few minutes ago, and you seemed to be enjoying yourself well enough." </p><p> "I always enjoy passin' a good time with you, angel." </p><p> "If you didn't play well with others, you wouldn't have run for mayor." She rolled over and straddled him. "Libras are not lone wolves, darling. A Libra male needs a permanent partner." </p><p> Nate's breath clogged in his lungs. "Permanent?" </p><p> Having grown up in South Louisiana, where water and land were constantly battling, with water winning most of the time, he knew that very few things were permanent. Especially relationships between men and women. </p><p> "We've been together six months," she pointed out, which exceeded any previous relationship Nate had ever had. Then again, it helped that she'd spent most of that time away, selling her astrology books at New Age festivals and talking them up on television talk shows around the country. </p><p> Doing some rapid calculation, Nate figured they'd probably been together a total of three weeks, and had spent most of that time in bed. </p><p> "I've been thinking," she murmured when he didn't respond. Her clever fingers slipped between them, encircling him. "About us." </p><p> "Us?" </p><p> "It occurred to me yesterday, when my flight was cruising at thirty thousand feet over New Mexico, that we should get married." </p><p> <i>Married?</i> Having not seen this coming -- she'd certainly never shown one iota of domesticity -- Nate didn't immediately answer. </p><p> "You don't want to." Danger sparked in her voice, like heat lightning flashing out over the Gulf. She pulled away. </p><p> Sighing, Nate hitched himself up beside her and saw any future plans for the night disappearing. </p><p> "It's nothing to do with you, <i>ch�re</i>." His cajoling smile encouraged one in return. "But we agreed goin' in that neither of us was the marrying kind." </p><p> "That was then." She left the bed and retrieved his shirt from where it had landed earlier. "Things change." The perfumed air swirled with temper. "The moon is also a mother sign." </p><p> "It is?" Nate caught the denim shirt she threw at him. Christ, he needed air. </p><p> "Yes." Her chin angled up. Her eyes narrowed to green slits. "Which is why Libras often repeat the same childlike behavior over and over again in their relationships." </p><p> It was a long way from charming to childish. Boyish, Nate might be willing to accept -- in the right context. But he hadn't been a child since that life-altering day when he was twelve and a liquored-up, swamp-dwelling, gun-carrying idiot had blown away his father. </p><p> "If I didn't know better, I might take offense at that, darlin'." He bent to pick up his jeans from the loblolly pine floor; one of his boots came sailing toward him. "Mon Dieu, Charlene." He ducked the first one and snagged the second out of the air an instant before it connected with his head. </p><p> "Do you have any idea how many proposals I get every month?" She marched back across the bedroom and jabbed her finger against his bare chest. </p><p> "I'll bet a bunch." Nate reminded himself that he'd never run into a situation he couldn't smooth over. </p><p> "You damn well bet a lot!" His chest now bore little crescent gouges from her fingernail. "I've turned down two in the past six weeks -- from men who make a hell of a lot more money than you -- because I was fool enough to think we had a future." </p><p> "You're a wonderful woman, ch�rie," he tried again, hopping on first one foot, then the other, as he pulled his pants up. "Smart, beautiful -- " </p><p> "And getting goddamn older by the moment," she shouted. </p><p> "You don't look a day over twenty-five." Thanks to a Houston surgeon whose clever touch with a scalpel had carved a good ten years off her face and body. </p><p> When she began coming toward him again, Nate backed away and yanked on his shirt. Not pausing to button it, he scooped his keys and wallet from the bedside table and shoved them into his pocket. "Twenty-six, tops." He debated sitting down again to pull on his boots, then decided not to risk it. </p><p> "It's not going to work this time, Callahan." </p><p> A champagne glass hit the wall, then shattered. She tossed her stiff cloud of honey blond hair. "If I'd taken the time to do your full chart before hiring you, I never would have let you seduce me." </p><p> Deciding that discretion was the better part of valor, Nate wisely didn't point out that she'd been the one who'd dropped the damn robe. </p><p> "I would have realized that you're suffering from a gigantic Peter Pan complex." </p><p> Peter Pan? Nate gritted his teeth. "I'll call you, <i>ch�re</i>," he promised as he dodged the second flute. PMS, he decided. "Later in the month. When you're feeling a little more like yourself." </p><p> A banshee could not have screamed louder. Nate escaped the suffocating room, taking the back stairs two at a time. Something thudded against the bedroom wall; he hoped to hell she hadn't damaged the new plaster job. </p><p> Feeling blindsided, Nate drove toward his home on the peaceful bank of Blue Bayou, trying to figure out where, exactly, an evening that had begun so promising had gone offtrack. </p><p> "Peter Pan," he muttered. </p><p> Where the hell had she come up with that one? </p><p> The full moon was brighter than he'd ever seen it, surrealistically silhouetting the knobby bayou cypresses in eerie white light. Having just survived Hurricane Charlene, Nate hoped it wasn't some weird portent of yet another storm to come. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by The Ross Family Trust</p></p><h2>The Color of Secrets</h2><p><p><b>Everyone has secrets, but some can change your life forever...</b></p><p>In the midst of the Second World War, Eva receives the devastating news that her husband is missing and presumed dead.

Financial expert Jeremy Siegel&#39;s Stocks for the Long Run has been celebrated by financial professionals and investors alike for its proven, no-nonsense approach to growing wealthy in the stock market. Nowhere else will you find this book&#39;s wealth of market-related data, and at the same time its shrewd (yet practical) advice, tips, and guidelines on how to strike the optimal balance between stock market risk and return. Packed with nearly 100 charts, graphs, and tables-many dating to the early 1800s and impossible to find anywhere else-Stocks for the Long Run gives you: The Nifty Fifty-Highly capitalized stocks that continue to outperform their rivals, and which companies could be the next stars of your investment portfolio!; a fascinating analysis of the October, 1987, stock market &#34;crash&#34;-how and why it occurred, and ways that savvy investors profited as others panicked; an in-depth analysis of opportunities in foreign markets-how to find them, and safely invest in overseas markets, to ultimately increase your long-term returns.</p><p>If anyone told you that investing in the stock market was the safest investment you could make, you might raise an eyebrow. However, if Jeremy Siegel tells you this, prepare to be convinced. Siegel's book, <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i>, is a comprehensive and highly readable history of the stock market that dramatically makes the case for long-term investing in stocks. <p> In summing up his approach to investing, Siegel writes, "Poor investment strategy, whether it is for lack of diversification, pursuing hot stocks, or attempting to time the market, often stems from the investor's belief that it is necessary to beat the market to do well in the market. Nothing is further from the truth. The principle of this book is that through time the after-inflation returns on a well-diversified portfolio of common stocks have not only exceeded that of fixed income assets but have actually done so with less risk. Which stocks you own is secondary to whether you own stocks, especially if you maintain a balanced portfolio."</p><p> <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i> considers subjects as diverse as the history of the various market indices and what makes for a business cycle to contrarian indicators and the utility of 200-day moving averages. If you've just come into investing in the last few years and feel the need for a solid and comprehensive text about the market, <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i> is probably the best primer available. It also works as an excellent reference for seasoned investors and anyone else interested in how the market works. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p>Jeremy Siegel's 1994 book, <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i>, makes for dry but very interesting reading. A finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Siegel has compiled some of the most thorough information about stock market performance over time relative to other asset classes that can be found for such a low price. The book is frequently used as a reference by various Fool HQ writers who are looking for the authoritative numbers on how stocks have done over various time periods. <p> Siegel analyzes stock returns and large-scale economic factors deftly, pausing to focus on specific historical issues that demonstrate the idea of stocks being a superior investment vehicle over long periods of time. His analysis of the performance of the Nifty Fifty stocks bought at their high in 1973 through the early 1990s is one particularly interesting stopping point, and his work on gold, recessions and taxes all make for interesting sidebars as well. Although some of the peripheral stuff may not exactly be Foolish, the general conclusion that stocks make superior long-term investment vehicles certainly is.</p></p><h2>A Christmas Far from Home: An Epic Tale of Courage and Survival during the Korean War</h2><p>The day after Thanksgiving, five months into the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur flew to American positions in the north and grandly announced an end-the-war-by-Christmas offensive, despite recent evidence of intervention by Mao's Chinese troops. Marching north in plunging temperatures, General Edward Almond's X Corps, which included a Marine division under the able leadership of General Oliver Smith, encountered little resistance. But thousands of Chinese, who had infiltrated across the frozen Yalu River, were lying in wait and would soon trap tens of thousands of US troops.<br><br>Led by the Marines, an overwhelmed X Corps evacuated the frigid, mountainous Chosin Reservoir vastness and fought a swarming enemy and treacherous snow and ice to reach the coast. Weather, terrain, Chinese firepower, and a 4,000-foot chasm made escape seem impossible in the face of a vanishing Christmas. But endurance and sacrifice prevailed, and the last troopships weighed anchor on Christmas Eve.<br><br>In the tradition of his <i>Silent Night</i> and <i>Pearl Harbor Christmas</i>, Stanley Weintraub presents another gripping narrative of a wartime Christmas season.<br><br><b>A Military Book Club main selection</b></p><p><b>Stanley Weintraub</b> is an award-winning author of notable histories and biographies, including the bestselling books on wartime Christmas seasons <i>Pearl Harbor Christmas</i> and <i>Silent Night</i>.

Her first novel, <i>The Savage Altar</i>, was awarded the Swedish Crime Writers&#x2019; Association prize for best debut. Its sequel, <i>The Blood Spilt</i>, was chosen as Best Swedish Crime Novel of 2004.<br><br>ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR:<br>Laurie Thompson is the distinguished translator of novels by Henning Mankell and H�kan Nesser. He was editor of <i>Swedish Book Review</i> between 1983 and 2002.I remember how we died. I remember, and I know. That&#x2019;s the way it is now. I know about certain things even though I wasn&#x2019;t actually present when they happened. But I don&#x2019;t know everything. Far from it. There are no rules. Take people, for instance. Sometimes they are open rooms that I can walk into. Sometimes they are closed. Time doesn&#x2019;t exist. It&#x2019;s as if it&#x2019;s been whisked into nothingness.<br><br>Winter came without snow. The rivers and lakes were frozen as early as September, but still the snow didn&#x2019;t come.<br><br>It was October 9. The air was cold. The sky very blue. One of those days you&#x2019;d like to pour into a glass and drink.<br><br>I was seventeen. If I were still alive, I&#x2019;d be eighteen now. Simon was nearly nineteen. He let me drive even though I didn&#x2019;t have a licence. The forest track was full of potholes. I liked driving. Laughed at every bump. Sand and gravel clattered against the chassis.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Bettan,&#x201d; Simon said to the car, stroking the cover of the glovebox.<br><br>We had no idea that we were going to die. That I would be screaming, my mouth full of water. That we only had five hours left.<br><br>The track petered out at Sevuj�rvi. We unpacked the car. I kept stopping to look round. Everything was divinely beautiful. I lifted my arms towards the sky, screwed up my eyes to look at the sun, a burning white sphere, watched a wisp of cloud scudding along&nbsp;high above us. The mountains embodied permanence and times immemorial.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Simon said.<br><br>I was still gazing at the sky, arms raised, when I said, &#x201c;Nearly all religions have something like this. Looking up, reaching up with your hands. I understand why. It makes you feel good. Try it.&#x201d;<br><br>I took a deep breath, then let the air out to form a big white cloud.<br><br>Simon smiled and shook his head. Heaved his weighty rucksack up onto a rock and wriggled into the harness. He looked at me.<br><br>Oh, I remember how he looked at me. As if he couldn&#x2019;t believe his luck. And it&#x2019;s true. I wasn&#x2019;t just any old bit of skirt.<br><br>He liked to explore me. Count all my birthmarks. Or tap his fingernail on my teeth as I smiled, ticking off all the peaks of the Kebnekaise massif: &#x201c;South Peak, North Peak, Dragon&#x2019;s Back, Kebnepakte, Kaskasapakte, Kaskasatj�kko, Tuolpagorni.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Upper right lateral incisor &#x2013; signs of decay; upper right central &#x2013; sound; upper left central &#x2013; distal filling,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d reply.<br><br>The rucksacks containing our diving equipment weighed a ton.<br><br>We walked up to Lake Vittangij�rvi. It took us three and a half hours. We urged each other on, noticing how the frozen ground made walking easier. We sweated a lot, stopped occasionally to have some water, and once to drink coffee from our thermos flask and eat a couple of sandwiches.<br><br>Frozen puddles and frostbitten moss crackled beneath our feet.<br><br>Alanen Vittangivaara loomed on our left.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s an old Sami sacrificial site up there,&#x201d; Simon said, pointing. &#x201c;Uhrilaki.&#x201d;<br><br>That was a side of him I loved. He knew about that sort of thing.<br><br>We finally got there. Placing our rucksacks carefully on the&nbsp;slope, we stood in silence for a while, gazing out over the lake. The ice resembled a thick black pane of glass over the water. Trapped bubbles traced patterns like broken pearl necklaces. The cracks resembled crumpled tissue paper.<br><br>Frost had nipped at every blade of grass, every twig, making them brittle and crispy white. Sprays of lingonberry and stunted juniper bushes were a dull shade of wintry green. Dwarf birches and blueberry sprigs had been squeezed into shades of blood and violet. And everything was coated with rime. An aura of ice.<br><br>It was uncannily quiet.<br><br>Simon became withdrawn and thoughtful, as he usually did. He&#x2019;s the type who can tell time to stand still. Or was. He was that kind of person.<br><br>But I&#x2019;ve never been able to keep quiet for long. I just had to start shouting. All that beauty &#x2013; it was enough to make you burst.<br><br>I ran out onto the ice. As fast as I could without slipping. Then I stood with my legs wide apart and slid a long, long way.<br><br>&#x201c;You have a go!&#x201d; I shouted to Simon.<br><br>He smiled and shook his head.<br><br>That was something he&#x2019;d learnt to do in the village where he&#x2019;d grown up. How to shake his head. They&#x2019;re good at that in Piilij�rvi.<br><br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; he shouted back. &#x201c;Someone has to be here to repair your legs when you&#x2019;ve broken them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cowardy cowardy custard!&#x201d; I yelled as I ran and slid again.<br><br>Then I lay down and gazed up at the sky for a while. Stroked the ice affectionately.<br><br>Somewhere down below there was an aeroplane. And nobody knew anything about it, apart from us. Or so we thought.<br><br>Standing up, I caught Simon&#x2019;s gaze.<br><br>You and me, his eyes said.<br> You and me, my eyes said.<br><br> Simon collected some dry juniper twigs and birch bark. So that we could start a fire and have something to eat before we made our dive. To give us the strength to keep going.<br><br>We grilled some smoked sausages on skewers. I didn&#x2019;t have the patience to do it properly &#x2013; mine were burnt black on the outside and raw inside. Hungry jays gathered in the trees around us.<br><br>&#x201c;People used to eat them,&#x201d; I said, nodding at the birds. &#x201c;Anni&#x2019;s told me about it. She and her cousins used to hang a length of string between the trees and thread pieces of bread onto it. The birds would land on the string, but it was so thin that they couldn&#x2019;t stay upright and found themselves hanging upside down. Then all you had to do was pick them off. Like picking apples. We ought to try it &#x2013; have we got any string?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you rather have a piece of sausage?&#x201d;<br> One of Simon&#x2019;s typically marvellous sardonic comments. And no hint of a smile to show that he was joking.<br><br>I gave him a thump on the chest.<br><br>&#x201c;Idiot! I didn&#x2019;t mean that we should eat them. I just wanted to see if it worked.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. We ought to get going. Before it gets dark.&#x201d;<br><br>Instantly I became serious.<br><br>Simon gathered some more dry twigs and bark. And he found a hollow birch log &#x2013; they burn well. He raked some ash over the glowing embers. As he said, with a bit of luck we would be able to blow the fire back to life after the dive. It would be good to be able to warm ourselves quickly when we emerged from the freezing water.<br><br>We carried our cylinders, regulators, masks, snorkels, fins and black army-surplus diving suits out onto the ice.<br><br>Simon led the way with the G.P.S.<br><br>In August we had brought the kayak, towing it through water whenever possible, along the River Vittangi as far as Lake Tahko. Then we&#x2019;d paddled to Vittangij�rvi. We&#x2019;d plumbed the depths of various parts of the lake, and, once we finally found the right place, Simon had keyed it into the G.P.S. under the heading<i>Wilma</i>.<br><br>But during the summer there were holidaymakers staying in the old farmhouse on the lake&#x2019;s western shore.<br><br>&#x201c;You can bet your life they&#x2019;re all lined up with their binoculars,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said, squinting across. <br>&#x201c;Wondering what the hell we&#x2019;re up to. If we dive now, everyone for kilometres around will know about it in no time.&#x201d;<br><br>So once we&#x2019;d finished, we&#x2019;d paddled over to the western shore, beached the kayak and strolled up to the old farmhouse, where we&#x2019;d been invited in for coffee. I went on about how we were getting paid a pittance by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for charting the depth of the lake. Something to do with climate change, I reckoned.<br><br>&#x201c;As soon as they close down the holiday cottages for the winter,&#x201d; I said to Simon as we struggled home with the kayak, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll be able to use their boat as well.&#x201d;<br><br>But then the ice came, and we had to wait until it was thick enough to bear our weight. We could hardly believe our luck when it didn&#x2019;t snow &#x2013; we&#x2019;d be able to see through the ice. A metre or so at least. But of course we&#x2019;d be diving down much deeper than that.<br><br>Simon sawed through the ice. He started by hacking a hole with an axe &#x2013; the ice was still thin enough to do that &#x2013; and then he used a hand saw. A chainsaw would have been too heavy to carry, and&nbsp;besides, it would have created a hell of a noise: the last thing we wanted was to attract attention. What we were doing suggested a book title to me:&nbsp;<i>Wilma, Simon and the Secret of the Aeroplane</i>.<br><br>While Simon was sawing through the ice, I nailed some lengths of wood together to form a cross we would place over the hole after attaching a safety line to it.<br><br>Stripping down to our thermal underwear, we pulled on our diving suits. Then we sat down at the edge of the ice hole.<br><br>&#x201c;Go right down to 4 metres,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;The worst that can happen is that we lose our air supply if the regulators freeze up. The start is the riskiest bit, just beneath the surface.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;O.K.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We might also run into trouble lower down. You can&#x2019;t trust mountain lakes. There could be an inlet somewhere, causing currents. The temperature could be below zero. The riskiest place is just beneath the surface, though. So: down you go. No hanging about.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;O.K.&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t want to listen. I wanted to get down there. Right away.<br><br>Simon wasn&#x2019;t an expert on the technical side of diving, but he&#x2019;d read up on it. In magazines and on the Internet. He continued his unhurried preparations.<br><br>&#x201c;Two tugs on the line means &#x2018;come up&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ll find the wreck straight away, but probably not.

Gabreski, the son of Polish immigrants who settled in Pennsylvania, nearly flunked out of Notre Dame but was nonetheless recruited by the Army Air Corps. In 1941, he was posted to Hawaii, where he lived through the attack on Pearl Harbor. Eager for action, Gabreski talked the Pentagon into assigning him to a Polish RAF squadron in England; he subsequently became the ETO's top ace, with 28 confirmed kills in 17 months of aerial combat. On the day the author was scheduled to return home to a hero's welcome, he flew one last mission and was shot down--and spent the last ten months of WW II behind the wire of a POW camp. Back in the States before V-J Day, Gabreski married his longtime sweetheart and left the military for a sales job at Douglas Aircraft. After almost two years of civilian life, however, he reenlisted with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Following a brief sojourn as a test pilot, Gabreski was sent to Korea in 1951 as a wing commander. Flying F-86 Sabrejets, he was credited with downing more than six enemy planes, making him a double ace. Retiring in 1967 as a full colonel, the author accepted an executive post with Grumman, where (save for a hectic two-year stint as the politically appointed president of the Long Island Railroad) he remained for the next 20 years. Gabreski devotes most of his understated text to matter-of- fact accounts of his combat experiences, leaving readers to speculate on just what made him such a deadly dogfighter. There's also a rather full roll call of erstwhile comrades in arms, most of whom add little to the narrative. These cavils apart, an often ingratiating memoir. (Sixteen pages of photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Gabreski was a top American ace in both WW II and Korea: in the European theater he downed a record 28 aircraft, and in Korea scored six kills. His accomplishments were perhaps astonishing because he came close to washing out in flight training. But his career had some other unusual twists as well. Son of Polish immigrants, Gabreski flew with a Polish squadron of the RAF before he joined the U.S. Air Force and, on the day he was to fly home after 166 missions, he was shot down and captured. He left the Air Force in 1967 and worked in the aircraft industry until 1978, when he became president of the Long Island Rail Road. He retired in 1987. His autobiography is a tale of high adventure and, with an assist from Molesworth, editor of the Skagit Valley Herald in Washington, he tells it with a matter-of-factness that heightens the impact.

Worshipped as a god in the culture of ancient Egypt, this beautiful and aloof creature has long been associated with magic and mythology, from the obligatory black cat featured in fairy tales and childhood stories to the more obscure folklore connections between cats and good luck or misfortune. Drawing on and inspired by the manuscripts of her great-grandmother, a Victorian wisewoman, Claire Nahmad explores the historical links between cats and spell-weaving, transcribing over fifty charms - some familiar, some more obscure - passed down through generations to form part of traditional English folklore. Some of the spells featured here bring good luck, and health and happiness in love; others enlist the help of cats to predict the weather and foretell the future; and there is even a section for the naming of cats and the qualities a particular name will encourage in the pet.</p><p></p><h2>Twilight</h2><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Sherryl Woods demonstrates that when faith and love are tested,&nbsp;they often wind up stronger than ever&nbsp;<br><br>For former private investigator Dana Miller, there can be no peace of mind until she finds the person who killed her husband.

She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>The blasted sofa must have belonged to the Marquis de Sade in another life, Rick Sanchez thought as he shifted his body in a futile attempt to find a more comfortable position. Between the oddly solidified lumps and protruding springs, he was lucky he hadn't gouged out a vital organ. He was very careful to avoid lying on his stomach.<br><br>This was the fourth night he'd gone through this same torture, and he was beginning to wonder if he was wasting his time. Whoever had been breaking into the Yo, Amigo headquarters either knew he'd moved in to guard the place or had simply decided that there was more fertile turf for theft elsewhere.<br><br>Lord knew, that was true enough, he thought as he cautiously rearranged his body once more on the worn-out, too-short sofa. The program he'd founded two years earlier was perpetually short of funds and equipment. The sole, ancient computer he'd hoodwinked a friend into donating had been an early victim of daring neighborhood thieves. Now about the only things of value lying around were the TV and DVD player in the lounge. They were bolted down, though not so securely that anyone intent on nabbing them couldn't manage it with a little time and diligence.<br><br>They were also in pathetic condition, but at least they'd been obtained legally, unlike the collection of state-of-the-art electronic equipment a few of the boys had offered him the week before. He'd really hated turning them down, but Yo, Amigo was all about taking a moral stance and teaching values. Accepting stolen property would pretty much defeat the very message he was trying to send out.<br><br>Exhausted but wide awake, he closed his eyes and tried counting confiscated weapons instead of sheep. He'd turned over a dozen to the police two days earlier, another seven the week before. It was a drop in the bucket, but each gun or knife he managed to get out of gang hands and off the streets was a small victory.<br><br>Rather than putting him to sleep, though, the mental game left him more alert than ever. Images of boys killing boys, of babies being shot by accident in a violent turf war crowded into his head. He wondered despondently if the program he'd founded would ever be more than a tiny, ineffective bandage on the huge problem.<br><br>Such thoughts led inevitably to memories of Ken Miller, the decent, caring man who had been his friend and, some said, had lost his life because of it. Rick knew he would never have a moment's peace again if he allowed himself to share that conviction. His conscience, which already carried a heavy enough burden of guilt from the sins of his youth, would destroy him, if even indirect responsibility for Ken's death were added to the list.<br><br>He shifted positions and felt the sharp jab of a metal spring in the middle of his back. He muttered a harsh expletive under his breath and sat up.<br><br>Just as he did, he thought he heard a faint whisper of sound, an almost imperceptible scratching from the back of the old brick firetrap that had been condemned until he took it over and began restoring it room by room with the help of the boys in his program. He went perfectly still and listened intently.<br><br>The second subtle scrape of metal against metal had him on his feet in an instant. He grabbed the baseball bat he'd kept by the door and eased from the office.<br><br>Slipping quietly through the shadowy rooms toward the increasingly persistent sound, he wished for a moment that he hadn't sworn off guns. He also wished the budget had been large enough to pay for a cell phone, rather than the lone, ancient phone that suddenly seemed very far away on his desk. He might as well have wished for a fleet of shiny new vans to transport the teens to the job assignments that were a part of the program. All were out of reach on the shoestring Yo, Amigo budget.<br><br>Just as he closed in on the back door, he heard the heavy-duty lock give. Whoever had conquered it was skilled with lock-picking tools, he concluded with grudging admiration. It hardly narrowed the field, since most of the kids he knew had been breaking and entering since they could reach a door handle or heave a rock through a window. Most, however, didn't have the finesse or patience to work at a lock with the tedious determination that this person had.<br><br>The heavy steel door inched open silently on its well-oiled hinges. Pressed against a wall, Rick waited in the shadows. There was no point in risking his neck until he knew exactly what he was up against. One thief. Two. Or a whole gang, in which case his goose was cooked and he could kiss the TV and DVD player goodbye.<br><br>To his relief, the lone person who slipped inside was slightly built and dressed in black from head to toe. Black baseball cap, long-sleeved black T-shirt, trim black pants, even black sneakers. Vaguely taken aback, he concluded it was the working gear of a pro, not some daring kid intent on mischief. The kids he knew wore the baggy clothes and colors of their gangs. Solid, formfitting black like this would have appalled them.<br><br>More on edge than ever, and itching for action, he studied the person creeping slowly and unwittingly toward him in the narrow hallway. Rick figured he easily had a fifty-pound advantage over the intruder, plus several inches in height. Even so, he forced himself to wait patiently and watch for accomplices.<br><br>When none appeared, he bit back a sigh of relief and considered his options. The bat seemed unnecessary. He propped it cautiously against the wall. Then he slipped up behind the increasingly confident and fast-moving thief and, without uttering a word, slammed the jerk onto the hardwood floor in a full-body tackle that knocked the breath out of both of them.<br><br>Rick recovered from the fall first, latched on to a pair of skinny wrists and brutally wrenched the would-be thief's arms behind him.<br><br>He received a blistering earful of curses for his trouble. The words didn't shock him. He'd heard far worse. Used far worse, for that matter.<br><br>What flat-out stunned him, though, was the fact that the voice uttering such foulmouthed language was so evidently and self-righteously outraged. More startling yet, it was also very clearly feminine.<br><br>"If you don't let me up right this instant, I will slap you with a lawsuit that will take away this building and every dime you have to your name," the woman vowed furiously.<br><br>Rick was intrigued despite himself. Not intrigued enough to let her go, but fascinated enough to pursue the conversational direction for a bit.<br><br>"Is that so?" he asked, unexpectedly amused by her gambit. "And how do you figure you're the injured party here?"<br><br>"Because I've been attacked by an idiot with more muscle than sense. I wouldn't be at all surprised if half my ribs were cracked."<br><br>"You did break into private property," he reminded her.<br><br>"A technicality," she insisted.<br><br>"Some technicality. You a lawyer?"<br><br>"Sweet heavens, no," she said with such heartfelt distaste that Rick grinned.<br><br>"I'm not overly fond of them myself. I guess that gives us something in common, doll face."<br><br><em>"Dollface? "</em> she repeated with more of that misplaced indignant outrage. "No one calls me doll face or honey or sweetheart."<br><br>"Too bad," Rick said sympathetically. He decided he could really enjoy deliberately aggravating this woman. "Mind telling me why you dropped by, doll face? Since you chose not to use the front door or to come during business hours, I have to assume your mission is less than legal."<br><br>"That's not true," she said.<br><br>"The facts say otherwise."<br><br>"To hell with your so-called facts. Are you going to let me up or not?"<br><br>"Not just yet," he said, wondering abruptly if the decision was the security precaution he wanted to believe or merely an attempt to prolong the distinctly provocative contact. Worry over his motives kept him silent for so long that his captive jumped back in with her two cents.<br><br>"If you're figuring on copping a feel, you'd better think again," she said in that imperious way that amused him so. "I'll slap you with sexual battery charges while I'm at it."<br><br>Rick chuckled. "Doll face, I do not need to get my kicks from accosting total strangers. In case you've missed the point, I am subduing a thief who broke into this building. I'm within my rights, believe me."<br><br>"I am not a thief," she retorted.<br><br>"Maybe not technically, since you never got a chance to lay your hands on anything of value," he agreed. "But you seem to be in deep denial of the seriousness of your position. Now, how about giving me some answers?"<br><br>She hesitated for a very long time, probably evaluating her alternatives, before asking, "Such as?"<br><br>"Who are you and what are you doing here?"<br><br>"Who are you?" she countered. "For all I know, you're just a thief who got here first."<br><br>She had audacity. Rick had to give her that. She was the kind of smart-mouthed handful who'd drive a man crazy. He wished he could get a better look at her to see if she'd be worth the trouble, but the lighting in the hallway was virtually nonexistent. The only thing he knew for sure was that she wasn't local. She had no accent. All of the girls in this neighborhood&#x2014;and some of them were indeed tough as nails&#x2014;were Latinas.<br><br>Based on her shape, though, this one definitely had promise. His own body had picked up on that without his brain even having to kick in. Another couple of minutes of close contact and he'd be dangerously aroused. Hell, he was already aroused. For a man who'd vehemently sworn to remain celibate through all eternity after his very brief and ill-advised marriage had gone sour, it was a troubling turn of events. He'd better settle this nonsense in a hurry and extricate himself from a dangerous situation.<br><br>"Let me assure you, doll face, I belong here," he said. "I run the place."<br><br>The announcement had an odd effect on her. Though she'd remained relatively still since he'd taken her captive, it now seemed that the remaining breath whooshed right out of her. She was utterly and absolutely motionless. That didn't strike Rick as a good sign.<br><br>"Doll face?"<br><br>"You're Rick Sanchez?" she asked in a broken whisper.<br><br>Rick couldn't tell if her voice was choked by tears or was shaking with some inexplicable anger, but he definitely got the feeling she knew a whole lot more about Yo, Amigo than he'd assumed. He also realized that he was the very last person she'd expected to encounter here tonight.<br><br>"That's me," he told her. "Which leaves us with you. Who are you, doll face?"<br><br>Several seconds ticked by before she answered.<br><br>"I'm Dana Miller."<br><br>She said it in a tone so stiff and cold that it sent goose bumps chasing over Rick's body. Dismay slammed through him as the name registered. Ken's wife? Dear God in heaven, he'd tackled Ken's wife as though she were a common criminal. Which, of course, at the moment she appeared to be, but that was beside the point.<br><br>He released her wrists at once and leaped to his feet, holding out his hand to help her up. She ignored it and rose with a grace and dignity that belied the situation.<br><br>"I'm sorry," he said, trying to convey a month's worth of emotions in those two simple words. "For everything. For Ken. For just now."<br><br>"Save it," she said harshly. "Save it for someone who'll buy your phony sympathy."<br><br>Anger radiated from her in almost palpable waves. Rick had known she blamed him for Ken's death. A half-dozen people had told him exactly how bitter she was toward him and Yo, Amigo. In fact, he had stayed away from the funeral for that very reason, out of consideration for her feelings, justified or not. He'd figured Ken's graveside was no place to force a confrontation. Later he'd tried to see her, but she'd been gone, off in Florida to recover from the tragedy, her best friend had told him.<br><br>Now he realized that he should have seen her sooner, should have gone at once to offer his condolences, to explain how deeply he, too, was grieving over the death of her husband. He doubted she would have believed him any more then than she did now, but he knew how wounds could fester unless they were cleansed right away. This soul-deep wound was no different than one to the flesh. It had had more than a month to worsen dangerously.<br><br>Ironically, he had anticipated that sooner or later, she might come after him. He just hadn't expected it to be in the middle of the night.<br><br>Gazing into her bleak expression, he tried to tell her now what he would have said weeks ago, if he'd had the opportunity.<br><br>"Your husband was the best friend&#x2014;"<br><br>He never got to finish the sentence. Her open hand connected with his face in a stinging slap that rocked him on his heels.<br><br>"Don't you dare say that," she said. "Don't you dare."<br><br>Rick fell silent, uncertain how to cope with such anguish and outrage. Used to coping with broken teenaged dreams with words and hugs and timeworn platitudes, he could think of nothing that would touch Dana Miller's hurt, or calm her fury. Obviously, she needed to lash out at someone and she'd picked him.<br><br>Since the topics of Ken Miller and his death were clearly off-limits, despite their obvious connection to tonight's break-in, he decided to focus on why Dana Miller was at Yo, Amigo headquarters in the middle of the night. It didn't take a genius to figure that one out.<br><br>"You expected to find answers here, didn't you?" he asked softly.<br><br>The direct question seemed to surprise her. Her gaze clashed with his. "It's the obvious place to start."<br><br>"The police thought so, too," he reminded her. "They've searched through every file, talked with every one of the kids who comes here regularly, questioned every potential eyewitness. They've almost destroyed the program in the process." He regarded her defiantly. "I won't let you start the whole thing all over again."<br><br>"You don't have a choice in the matter," she told him coldly. "I will do whatever I have to do to find Ken's murderer. You can't stop me."<br><br>He found her resolve chilling, but it bolstered his own commitment to salvage Yo, Amigo, at any cost. "Oh, but I can. These kids need a safe haven. They need one person who believes in them. That's me. They had Ken, too, but he's gone now."<br><br>"Because of you," she accused bitterly.<br><br>"Not because of me or these kids," Rick insisted. "I'd stake my life on that."<br><br></p><h2>Cowboy Values: Recapturing What America Once Stood For</h2><p><p>Jim Owen leads a massively successful seminar that is in huge demand by financial groups, teachers&#x2019; organizations, and professional associations. His first book, Cowboy Ethics, has sold more than 60,000 copies in two years. Now Owen continues his nonpartisan message, offering the legacy of the cowboy as a model of accessible, positive qualities that all can agree on, regardless of religion or political persuasion.</p><p>This new book explains the enduring values he observed in cowboys, ones that can lead us to personal and professional fulfillment: a can-do&#x201d; spirit, authenticity, courage, strength of character, humbleness, chivalry, and heart. Accompanied by striking full-color photos, this motivational guide is the only book of its kind, and it will inspire readers from all walks of life in the tradition of best sellers such as Fish!, Good to Great, and Think and Grow Rich.</p></p><p>Americans are known for being optimists, but it doesn't take a cynic to see that our country is seriously off-track. We're upset by greedy corporate executives, who line their own pockets at others' expense; we're disgusted by gutless politicians, who pander to special interest groups; and we're appalled by a culture that glorifies materialism and self-gratification. It's as if "What's in it for me?" were our national motto. No wonder so many of us feel a deep yearning for a simpler time when civility was the norm and a handshake could seal any deal. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can't turn back the clock or legislate our way out of society's malaise. But here's what we <i>can </i>do:&nbsp;Look to the bedrock values all Americans share. We many never agree on Iraq, abortion, or how to boost our economy, but surely we can agree that "Our word should be our bond."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a definition of those shared values, we need to look no further than the Cowboy Way. Living by a code that centers on principles like honesty, loyalty, and courage, the working cowboy is an enduring American hero--one providing just the kind of inspiration our country needs to find unity and hope in these troubled times. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not too late for us to get back to the qualities that made America great. <i>Cowboy Values </i>gives us a great place to start.<b>James P.

These all emanate from the creations of Po Shun Leong, an architect and artist who fashions magnificent, detailed, and one-of-a-kind wooden boxes. Inspired during his childhood by a huge wooden model of an ocean liner, Leong has never lost his fresh outlook on the world. For the first time, the entire range of his work appears in a single volume. Leong&#39;s architectural roots led him originally to design chairs, many of which appear here, including ones in fiberglass and polyurethane. Then he began forming his often playful boxes, which grew increasingly detailed through the years. Leong claims they&#39;re about &#34;magic and drama&#34;, and every design here proves that point. Some figures take their inspiration from surrealist art, while others feature totems and towers. &#34;Figurative Box&#34; (1996) has a muted palette created by bleaching and dying. The highly intricate &#34;Modern Times&#34; takes its name from the Chaplin film and began a series of wall-mounted boxes: it has elements recalling cogs, wheels, and other machinery parts. &#34;Mask Boxes&#34; capture aspects of tribal art, and various &#34;Pompeii&#34; vessels widen at the top, providing a powerful image of volcanic explosion. Arks, coffee tables, and more complete the collection. Specific how-to-build instructions, design elements, and construction drawings for several will be treasured plans in any shop. The entire process of creation -- from inspiration, to sketching, sanding, finishing, and bleaching -- unfolds here in all its glory.</p><p>In a sense, the craft of art boxes is comparable to the assembling of a Chinese meal--this time, in wood. In one of the most fascinating how-to books to appear in quite a while, Leong and Lydgate provide an incredible impetus for even nonwoodworkers to try their hands and band saws. Constructing art boxes is a sophisticated marriage of architecture and art as fundamental shapes such as cones, obelisks, and pyramids are fitted together whimsically (but not haphazardly) into coffee tables, boxes, and collages. A gallery of Leong's work serves as an appetizer, which is followed by five different projects. No scrap of wood is wasted; all necessary details are included, along with photographs. Nothing has yet equaled the imaginative pieces presented here. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Official Nintendo Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls Player's Guide</h2><p>The Only Official Guide from the Insiders at Nintendo <p>THE FINAL AUTHORITY </p><p>Packed with maps, strategy and monster info, the Official Player's Guide from Nintendo Power is your source for all things Final Fantasy. </p><p>Complete maps that show the location of each treasure and item </p><p>A full, in-depth walk-through of both games, including all bonus areas </p><p>Detailed bestiaries describing the strengths and weaknesses of the games' 364 monsters </p><p>Strategies for solving every puzzle and defeating every boss </p><p>Includes bonus foldout maps of both worlds! </p><p>Complete strategy for the Game Boy Advance game - Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls</p></p><p></p><h2>Santa Fe Houses</h2><p>Santa Fe-style decorating is a coast-to-coast trend.

The son of racing legend Graham Hill, Damon entered Formula One in 1992, racing for Brabhams and then Williams and took over as team leader when Senna died in 1994. Having lost the 1994 World Championship to Schumacher by a single point, Hill was crowned World Champion in 1996. After retiring in 1999, Hill pursued various business ventures as well as becoming president of the British Racing Driver&#39;s Club in 2006. He now works as a commentator on SKYF1.The afterlife of this particular world champion has not always been easy, thanks to the fight against depression and a couple of unsatisfactory business ventures, but the upside includes a decision to resume the educational path he left almost 40 years ago . . . That may have encouraged him to tell a remarkable story in his own words, and to do so with eloquence, directness and insight. -- Richard Williams * Guardian *</p><h2>Disney&#39;s Aladdin (Disney Classic Series)</h2><p>Full-color throughout.</p><p></p><h2>A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry (The Modern Library of the World&#39;s Best Books. 101.3)</h2><p>Representative selections from the writings of major American poets from the seventeenth century to the present</p><p>Aiken was an American poet, short story writer, critic and novelist.</p><h2>Infinity Inc.: The Generations Saga Vol. 1</h2><p>Shunned by their parents and mentors in the Justice Society of America, Infinity, Inc. is a team made up of the best and brightest new heroes from the next generation of DC Comics.<p>Collecting a 1980s classic at last, INFINITY INC. follows the adventures of the Justice Society of America&#x2019;s sons and daughters as they pick up the role of crime-fighters from their parents.

I&#x2019;d like to sit by a fire and tell people stories &#x2013; make them see pictures, make them cry and laugh, take them anywhere emotionally with something as deceptively simple as words. I&#x2019;d like to tell tales to move their souls and transform them. I&#x2019;ve always wanted to be able to do that. Imagine how the great writers must feel, knowing they have that power. I sometimes feel I could do it. It&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;d like to develop. In a way, songwriting uses the same skills, creates the emotional highs and lows, but the story is a sketch. It&#x2019;s quicksilver. There are very few books written on the art of storytelling, how to grip listeners, how to get a group of people together and amuse them. No costumes, no makeup, no nothing, just you and your voice, and your powerful ability to take them anywhere, to transform their lives, if only for minutes. <br><br>I think I have a goody-goody image in the press and I hate that, but it&#x2019;s hard to fight because I don&#x2019;t normally talk about myself. I am a shy person. It&#x2019;s true. I don&#x2019;t like giving interviews or appearing on talk shows. When Doubleday approached me about doing this book, I was interested in being able to talk about how I feel in a book that would be mine &#x2013; my words and my voice. I hope it will help clear up some misconceptions. <br><br>Everybody has many facets to them and I&#x2019;m no different. When I&#x2019;m in public, I often feel shy and reserved. Obviously, I feel differently away from the glare of cameras and staring people. My friends, my close associates, know there&#x2019;s another Michael that I find it difficult to present in the outlandish &#x201c;public&#x201d; situations I often find myself in. <br><br>It&#x2019;s different when I&#x2019;m onstage, however. When I perform, I lose myself. I&#x2019;m in total control of that stage. I don&#x2019;t think about anything. I know what I want to do from the moment I step out there and I love every minute of it. I&#x2019;m actually relaxed onstage. Totally relaxed. It&#x2019;s nice. I feel relaxed in a studio too. I know whether something feels right. If it doesn&#x2019;t, I know how to fix it. Everything has to be in place and if it is you feel good, you feel fulfilled. People used to underestimate my ability as a songwriter. They didn&#x2019;t think of me as a songwriter, so when I started coming up with songs, they&#x2019;d look at me like: &#x201c;Who really wrote that?&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know what they must have thought &#x2013; that I had someone back in the garage who was writing them for me? But time cleared up those misconceptions. You always have to prove yourself to people and so many of them don&#x2019;t want to believe. I&#x2019;ve heard tales of Walt Disney going from studio to studio when he first started out, trying to sell his work unsuccessfully and being turned down. When he was finally given a chance, everyone thought he was the greatest thing that ever happened. <br><br>Sometimes when you&#x2019;re treated unfairly it makes you stronger and more determined. Slavery was a terrible thing, but when black people in America finally got out from under the crushing system they were stronger. They knew what it was to have your spirit crippled by people who are controlling your life. They were never going to let that happen again. I admire that kind of strength. People who have it take a stand and put their blood and soul into what they believe. <br><br>I believe performers should try to be strong as an example to their audiences. It&#x2019;s staggering what a person can do if they only try. If you&#x2019;re under pressure, play off that pressure and use it to advantage to make whatever you&#x2019;re doing better. Performers owe it to people to be strong and fair. <br><br>Often in the past performers have been tragic figures. A lot of truly great people have suffered or died because of pressure or drugs, especially liquor. It&#x2019;s so sad. You feel cheated as a fan that you didn&#x2019;t get to watch them evolve as they grew older. One can&#x2019;t help but wondering what performances Marilyn Monroe would have put in or what Jimi Hendrix might have done in the 1980s. <br><br>A lot of celebrities say they don&#x2019;t want their children to go into show business. I can understand their feelings, but I don&#x2019;t agree with them. If I had a son or daughter, I&#x2019;d say, &#x201d;By all means, be my guest. Step right in there. If you want to do it, do it.&#x201d; <br><br>To me, nothing is more important than making people happy, giving them a release from their problems and worries, helping them to lighten their load. I want them to walk away from a performance I&#x2019;ve done saying, &#x201d;That was great. I want to go back again. I had a great time.&#x201d; To me, that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s all about. That&#x2019;s wonderful. That&#x2019;s why I don&#x2019;t understand when some celebrities say they don&#x2019;t want their kids in the business. <br><br>I think they say that because they&#x2019;ve been hurt themselves.

Through Hitler&#39;s great trust in him and Speer&#39;s own genius for organisation he became, effectively from 1942 overlord of the entire war economy, making him the second most powerful man in the Third Reich. Sentenced to twenty years imprisonment in Spandau Prison at the Nuremberg Trails, Speer attempted to progress from moral extinction to moral self-education. How he came to terms with his own acts and failures to act and his real culpability in Nazi war crimes are the questions at the centre of this book. The author had access to Speer, his family and friends and his private papers.</p><p>Gitta Sereny's biography meticulously re-creates for the reader the professional, emotional, and psychological life of Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and later his Minister of Armaments. Throughout the 12-year history of the Third Reich, Speer remained one of Hitler's most trusted confidants and one of the most powerful political leaders of the Nazi party. Researched and written over an eight year period, <i>Albert Speer</i> weaves together information from innumerable personal interviews with Speer, his family, close friends, and professional colleagues, the author's own solid grasp of German history, and critical readings of Speer's own writings, including various drafts of his memoirs, <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>, first published in 1969. <p> Throughout, Sereny consciously avoids the pitfall of many Speer biographers, who seek to either blame or exculpate Speer for the Nazi's atrocities. Instead, she succeeds in helping the reader understand a "morally extinguished" man and place into context "all the crimes against humanity which Hitler initiated, which continue to threaten us today, and of which Speer, who was in many ways a man of excellence, sadly enough made himself a part." Well over 700 pages, <i>Albert Speer</i> is not a quick read, but superbly written and meticulously researched, it is a pleasure to read, providing unprecedented insight into one of the most complex figures in modern German history. <i>--Bertina Loeffler</i></p>s of photographs</p><h2>What Life Could Mean to You</h2><p>The famous psychiatrist examines the causes of emotional and psychological problems and relates them to the normal pattern of personality development</p><p>Colin Brett is an accredited Adlerian counselor and former Training Officer of the Adlerian Society of Great Britain.

Original.</p><p>John Shirley, often cited as the first writer of cyberpunk, has been for some years a topnotch craftsman of horror fiction. Those familiar with his novel <i>Wetbones</i> and his short story collections, <i>Heatseeker</i> and <i>New Noir</i>, treasure his work for its antic humor, neon intensity, and oddly endearing descriptions of graphic horror. It's an indication of how unique Shirley is that reviewers have compared him to such varied writers as J.G. Ballard, William S. Burroughs, Anton Chekov, Philip K. Dick, Franz Kafka, William Kotzwinkle, Elmore Leonard, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Tom Wolfe.<p> <i>Black Butterflies</i> is in two parts: eight stories set in "This World" (what we call reality) and eight stories set in "That World" (where the door swings open into the realm of the surreal, the supernatural). In "This World" we meet a middle-class white woman who turns a mugging by two black youngsters into her chance to pursue glory as a criminal; a cop who knows his partner is guilty of murdering his wife; two hustlers who throw a sadistic and drug-infested party at the expense of their bound and unwilling host (believe it or not, it's <i>hilarious</i>); "a girl who died from cum"; and two bike messengers whose fate is to join hundreds of other people in a freak accident so hideous it boggles the mind. Almost all of them seem to find some kind of manic deliverance in the most outlandish and horrific of circumstances. In "That World" we creep down a tunnel into a child's escape from reality, witness more than one scene of surreal cannibalism in the service of sexual pleasure and/or artistic creation, and participate with horror and awe in a religious rite in the final days of the human species. </p><p> John Shirley visits some very strange places, but he always comes back to tell of his adventures in a spare, unaffected voice. He can carry you into the edgiest of human situations and bring you back giggling nervously. Take the risk; go on a ride with him. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Best known as one of the founders of cyberpunk for his novel City Come A-Walkin' (1980) and as the principal screenwriter of the cult classic film The Crow, Shirley (Silicon Embrace, 1996) has a reputation as one of the darkest, edgiest, boldest writers around?a reputation that will only be enhanced by this first-rate and fierce collection of 16 stories that includes two originals. The collection is divided into two parts: "This World" is comprised of tales set in everyday reality, although the events, characters and themes covered are anything but ordinary; "That World" contains supernatural horror, dark fantasy and SF yarns. The lead-off entry, "Barbara," is prototypical Shirley, a skin-crawler of a story about a woman carjacked by two punks who outwits, and outsociopaths, them at every turn. Like most of Shirley's stories, it's laid down in adrenalized, jivey yet extremely artful prose that fairly skids across the page, dragging the reader along with it into shadowed corners of terror and desire. Yet while it's thrilling, there's psychological depth in it, too, as Shirley bores into the brains of his characters, revealing the motivations of those who walk on the wild side. Shirley loses nothing when he moves toward the fantastic. A representative tale in the book's second part is "How Deep the Taste of Love," in which a newly minted widower gets to explore his outre sexual fantasies, and then some, with a beautiful bar pickup. Here, as throughout this blade of a book, Shirley casts a story in which the veil of normalcy and habit is ripped away and his characters, and readers, are invited to behold the fundamental mystery of life. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Victor Higgins: An American Master</h2><p>&#34;This exhaustive monograph establishes Victor Higgins&#39;s place in the greater pantheon of American art. With Georgia O&#39;Keefe, Higgins can be seen as one of the two best painters of the people and places in the American Southwest.&#34;</p><p>Victor Higgins's intensely lit paintings of Taos, N.M., capture the area's austere beauty as well as the self-reliance, dignity and age-old traditions of the Native Americans. Although he was a cerebral artist who painted in a three-piece suit, Higgins (1884-1949) created works whose integrity and purity arguably place them with the best of George Bellows, John Sloan, Reginald Marsh and Georgia O'Keeffe. His strong, semi-mystical landscapes, from which human figures are usually absent, seem like transcendent revelations. Cubist-influenced watercolors of storms and mountains are reminiscent of John Marin. Higgins's Aspens series has a universal appeal, and the "Little Gems" of the 1940s--jewel-like oils of pueblo towns and sprawling mountains--make every brush stroke count. Director of the Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame, Porter writes with authority and verve in this breathtakingly illustrated study, which accompanies a traveling exhibition. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Higgins (1884-1949) is best known for landscape paintings and scenes of Indian life in and around the artist's colony of Taos, New Mexico. This lavishly produced catalog accompanies a traveling exhibit of Higgins's work and aims to establish his place in the "greater pantheon of American art." The artist's early life is explored, as are the fruitful years in Taos, where he refined techniques, met other artists, and became acquainted with D.H. Lawrence and Mabel Dodge. The watercolors and oils are distinguished by bold forms and brilliant colors. The paintings, though quite pleasing, probably don't support the author's claim that Higgins is an "American master." However, this carefully researched book is certainly recommended for libraries with a strong interest in the art of the American Southwest.<br><i>- Ste phen Rees, Bucks Cty.

In addition, Christian theologians have long described beauty as a third inseparable reality which together with goodness and truth, paint a full picture of who God is.&nbsp; Alabaster aims to give the reader a fresh visual experience and heightened level of contemplation while reading this ancient text, that ultimately points to the beauty of God.<br> <i><b></b></i><i><em><b>Why Alabaster?</b><br><ul><li><b>Thoughtful Design:&nbsp;</b>Design matters. We create with the reader in mind--careful use of negative space, legible typefaces, and layouts that allow a thoughtful exploration between text and images.</li><li><b>Compelling Imagery:</b>&nbsp;Our approach reimagines the entire experience of the book.

It was theologian Hans Urs Von Balthassar who once wrote that without beauty, goodness looses its attractiveness and truth loses its cogency. We live in a visual culture. Anyone can make an image and we are shaped by what we see. We value bringing this visual reality to a faith-based context. We believe in the divine inspiration, trustworthiness and authority of the Bible--and we bring this into everything we make and do.Kalos is the word for beauty in the original Greek; it literally means beautiful as a sign of inward goodness. This means beauty isn&#39;t just an aesthetic--it&#39;s a way of going through the world. To live beautifully is to live a life that contributes to human flourishing--in our work, in our relationships, in our communities.Alabaster Co. began late one night when friends Bryan Chung and Brian Chung were deep in discussion on creativity and God. Reflecting on the direction culture was taking toward visual images, innovation and design, an idea was born: create a brand passionate about fully exploring the intersection of creativity, beauty, and faith. Realizing that beauty is a foundational value when talking about creativity and God, they decided to name the company Alabaster, after one of the only times Jesus uses the word beautiful in the Gospels. In Mark 14:1-9, a woman breaks an alabaster jar of incredibly expensive perfume onto Jesus&#39; head. Many people in the room scoff at her and say what she has done is a complete waste. But Jesus defends the woman saying, &#34;leave her alone, why do you bother her? What she has done is a beautiful thing.&#34; It is this complete act of sacrificial giving which Jesus calls - in the original greek - kalos, which literally means beautiful as a sign of inward goodness. We wanted to have this same level of intentionality and thoughtfulness as the woman did as we created Alabaster. Alabaster was officially launched on Kickstarter in October 2016 with its first project: Alabaster: The Bible Beautiful. After a successful launch, the books were printed and a conversation began. Since then, we&#39;ve put the books on Amazon, made new projects and are planning for the future, all with the same passion: explore the intersection of creativity, beauty, and faith for the sake of a more beautiful human flourishing.</p><h2>Jubal&#39;s Raid: General Early&#39;s Famous Attack on Washington in 1864</h2><p>During the summer of 1864 General Grant was hammering at the gates of Richmond and the Confederacy seemed doomed. In a bold and desperate stroke, General Lee countered by sending Jubal A. Early and a force of only twelve thousand men toward Washington, D.C. After some victories along the way, they crossed the Potomac and caused plenty of confusion and consternation in the capital before retreating. Early reportedly said: &#34;We haven&#39;t taken Washington, but we&#39;ve scared Abe Lincoln like hell!&#34; In fact, Lincoln kept cool, but a lot of others on the Union side did not. The story of that daring diversion, its losses and gains, is memorably told in Jubal&#39;s Raid.</p><p>"<i>Jubal's Raid</i> is . . . accurate, concise, swift-paced, conveying something of the thrill of danger which the North felt as Jubal A.

Cherryh three-time winner of the coveted Hugo Award is one of today&#39;s best-selling and most critically acclaimed writers of science fiction and fantasy. The author of more than fifty novels, she makes her home in Spokane, Washington.Direct sequel to Heavy Time (1991) and part of Cherryh's medium-future Company Wars spacefaring saga (Cyteen, etc.) about a thoroughly disunited Solar System facing invasion by genetically engineered superman. Now serving with the United Defense Command fleet, ex-Belter and former space-miner Ben Pollard is poised to grab the Earth- based job he has long coveted--when abruptly he is reassigned to the remote space station Sol Two. Seems that a former shipmate, the apparently jinxed Paul Dekker, has gone more or less insane after an ``accident'' and has named Ben as next of kin! Protesting, Ben interviews Dekker, and realizes that some sort of coverup is going on. Dekker was working on a top-secret military project rife with rivalries and backbiting. Ben, accepting his situation, investigates; helped by tough Belter ex-miners and former shipmates Sal and Meg, he exposes a furious tangle of politicking and power- struggling among Earth's top military brass, powerful family- connected politicians, and the ubiquitous Earth Company. Characters well up to par, and the backdrop as solid as ever- -but the plot, slow to develop and desperately short of propellant, quickly subsides into flabby confusion. A disappointment after sparkling work last time out. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Whether Christian, Jewish or Muslim-their work is religiously or spiritually motivated. They are religious or socio-ethical entrepreneurs, who have invented organizations or movements to repair the world. What shaped and formed them? How do they integrate a progressive social agenda with their faith? How do they exercise public leadership in a world where women's public roles are sometimes still suspect? The book is thematically organized and touches on many of the most relevant topics being discussed today: separation of church and state, the intersection of politics and religion, the silence of the progressive left and the embodiment of authentic religious pluralism. This book claims space for progressive forms of religion in an area dominated by the Religious Right. <br>&nbsp;<i>God's Troublemakers</i>&nbsp;is based on extensive interviews with 11 women social entrepreneurs. The 3 best known are Sr. Helen Prejean, the anti-death-penalty activist; Ruth Messenger, former Manhattan Borough President and now executive director of American Jewish World Service; and Helen LaKelly Hunt, who has been a national activist funding women's causes and a leader in persuading secular feminists to make common cause with religious women.</p></p><p>Katharine Rhodes Henderson is an ordained Presbyterian minister, who for the past decade has been the executive vice president of Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City.

The next day, Luella refuses to give any milk. And the day after that is the same.

And then the thought of the one thing even more dreadful and terrible than that - for my diary never to be read by the one person who would or could understand. For I do want it to be read - there is no use concealing the fact - by somebody who is like me, who would understand.<br>Jeb Alexander was a gay man who lived in Washington, D.C., during the first half of the twentieth century. From 1918, when he was nineteen years old, until the late 1950s, he chronicled his daily life engagingly and unsparingly, leaving behind a unique record of ordinary gay life before Stonewall, a history that has remained largely hidden until now.<br>Jeb came of age as the century did, witnessing and recording political and social change from the position of insider as an editor for the U.S. Government and outsider as a gay man. Painfully shy, and frustrated in his ambition to be a novelist by writer's block, Jeb turned to his diary as a way of expressing himself as well as recording events, creating a full emotional self-portrait and unforgettable sketches of the men who made up his lively circle of friends.<br>Jeb and Dash also details the joy and anguish of an extraordinary on-and-off love affair between Jeb and C. C. Dasham (Dash), whom he met in college and with whom he remained friends throughout his life.<br>A rare and important historical document, a beautifully written memoir, a love story, an ode to old Washington, D.C., Jeb and Dash is a remarkable find and an enduring literary achievement.</p><p>In 1965 Ina Russell inherited 50 volumes of diaries in a fireproof cabinet from her uncle Jeb Alexander (pseudonym). Unbeknownst to her was the treasure trove of American gay history they would yield. Upon reading the eloquently written memoirs, she discovered her uncle's tempestuous love affair with C.C. Dash Dasham (pseudonym) and life as a gay government employee in Washington. Russell winnowed the volumes into an engrossing narrative of gay life from 1918 to 1945. Reading Jeb's diaries is to walk beside him and relive the sights, sounds, and smells of the Roaring Twenties, Depression, and World War II. A door has been opened here to view gay life firsthand in bygone eras. In 1923 Jeb wrote prophetically concerning his diary, "I do want it to be read--there is no use in concealing the fact--by somebody who is like me, who would understand." A superlative insight into early 20th-century gay history.<br><i>- Michael A. Lutes, Univ. of Notre Dame Lib., Ind.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.The torment and loneliness of homosexuality in a more repressive era is palpably evoked in this intense diary of Jeb Alexander (1899-1965), the pseudonym for Russell's uncle. Jeb, who was an editor in a government office in Washington, D.C., bequeathed to Russell 50 volumes of diaries from which she distilled this selection. Extending from the WW I armistice to the stock market crash to the defeat of fascism, this gracefully written diary includes myriad impressions of topical events and people like Will Rogers, Pola Negri, Thornton Wilder, Charles Lindbergh and others. But the unifying thread is Jeb's love affairs, including his long time relationship with C. C. Dasham, a state department employee. Readers are privy to Jeb's fears that he may be under police surveillance as a suspected "deviant" criminal, and to his distress over an unsympathetic society that allows him little happiness or peace of mind.

Discover how African-American culture has become a powerful voice in modern society.</p><p>Mary Colson is a teacher and a writer. She is fascinated by the world and the cultures of different countries, with their unique myths and legends.Part of the History in Literature series, this book will be read by teens who love Morrison's novel and want to learn more about its historical and cultural setting and connections to Morrison's personal experience, as well as by those who are interested in literary analysis. The bold type used throughout for special vocabulary interrupts the flow of text (and it is certainly unnecessary for an audience familiar with Morrison's work), and notes for the interesting quotes would have been helpful. The page design, however, is inviting, with lots of boxed insets, photos, and subheads, and the talk about themes such as the search for love, identity, and racial pride will spark discussion and stimulate teens to read the novel or savor it again. A time line, a bibliography, and a lengthy glossary defining the boldface terms are appended. An effective book that will deepen and strengthen the connections between history and literature for students. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In addition, Dr Claire Weekes offers advice to those whose illness is dominated by a particular fear - agoraphobia.</p><p><b>Dr. Claire Weekes</b> is the author of the bestselling <b>Peace from Nervous Suffering</b>, also available in a Signet edition. In addition, Dr. Weekes, best known for her pioneering work in the study of nervous illness and anxiety, has lectured at psychiatric hospitals in Britain and has spoken often on radio and television both in Britain and in the United States.<b>1<br><br>Sensitization: The Simple Cause of So Much Nervous Illness</b><p>If nervous suffering has led you to this book, you may have picked it up with both hope and doubt. Possibly you have tried so hard to recover in the past and have&#x2014;as you think&#x2014;let yourself down so often that you may hesitate to trust yourself to try again. Perhaps you have been ill so long you suspect you are beyond help. Small wonder doubt is mixed with hope. And yet, I assure you, however often you may have failed in the past, however long you may have suffered, you can recover.</p><p>Perhaps, like so many of my nervously ill patients, you have no personality defect making or keeping you ill; indeed, you may have no particular problem except finding the way to recovery. Many of my patients were happy in their home life and at work until they became ill. They then became afraid of the state they were in, of the way they felt&#x2014;not only of what was happening at the time but also of what they feared might yet be in store. Without realizing it, their nerves had tricked them, duped them.</p><p>TRICKS YOUR NERVES PLAY</p><p>Through the years I have seen every shade of every trick my patients&#x2019; nerves have played upon them; I saw how easily, how unwittingly, many were led into nervous illness, and because of this I want to open your eyes to the way your nerves could now be tricking you.</p><p>We should know there are three special pitfalls that can lead to nervous illness, and above all we should know how to cope with them. The three pitfalls are sensitization, bewilderment, and fear. Sensitization is a state in which nerves are conditioned to react to stress in an exaggerated way; that is, they bring unusually intense feelings when under stress, and at times with alarming swiftness.</p><p>There is no mystery about sensitization. Most of us have surely felt it in a mild way when we have been working under pressure and our nerves have become alerted to respond too quickly, too acutely, to situations that would, at other times, leave us unmoved. When mildly sensitized, we may be irritated by those near us, impatient with driving home in heavy traffic or waiting for the evening bus. We continue working, driving, traveling, however, and these feelings will gradually pass.</p><p>On the other hand, severe sensitization can be upsetting indeed. Besides feeling painfully edgy and agitated, a severely sensitized person may feel his heart constantly beating quickly, &#x201c;missing&#x201d; beats, or thumping; he may have recurring attacks of palpitations; he may feel his stomach churn&#x2014;especially on waking in the morning or after an afternoon nap. His hands may tremble and sweat. He may have difficulty expanding his chest to take in a deep breath and may&#x2014;in the words of one woman&#x2014;gasp and gulp for air. He may complain of a lump in his throat which seems to interfere with swallowing solid food, or he may have weak turns. He may suffer from headaches&#x2014;a feeling of weight pressing on top of his head, of an &#x201c;iron band&#x201d; around it; giddiness; or a sensation of lurching, swaying, or of being pulled to one side while walking.</p><p>Most alarming of all, panic may come so easily and swiftly that the slightest shock may bring it: perhaps no more than the unexpected sound of a slamming door. More bewildering still, panic may come for no apparent reason. Although these are no more than the usual symptoms of stress exaggerated by sensitization, the sufferer rarely recognizes them as stress symptoms. He thinks they are unique to him, that no one could have possibly suffered this way before.</p><p>SUDDEN SENSITIZATION</p><p>One need not be a special type to become sensitized. Quite severe sensitization can be suddenly and unexpectedly thrust upon any one of us at any time. It may follow the stress of a physical shock to our nerves, such as an exhausting surgical operation, a heavy hemorrhage, a difficult confinement, an accident, and so on.</p><p>For example, when severe sensitization follows a surgical operation, the simplest postoperative routine&#x2014;such as a finger prick for a blood count or the dressing of a wound&#x2014;can almost reduce its victim to tears. Any frustration, perhaps no more than waiting for the doctor to arrive, may bring intense agitation and make nerves feel so taut that a sudden noise jars painfully. Also, panic can follow the slightest anxious thought: hence the necessity to understand sensitization and know how to cope with it.</p><p>A retired nursing sister who had been in charge of a surgical ward for years said recently, &#x201c;If I had known more about sensitization when I was nursing, how much more understanding I could have given my patients.&#x201d; At that time she was sensitized herself.</p><p>GRADUAL SENSITIZATION</p><p>Of course, severe sensitization can come about more slowly. It may gradually accompany continuous domestic stress, too strenuous dieting, a debilitating illness&#x2014;anything that puts nerves under stress for a prolonged time. The stress need not necessarily be unhappy. An actor constantly alert to give his best performance may become quite sensitized, especially if he neglects sleep and food.</p><p>THE PATTERN IS LIMITED</p><p>Since the symptoms of sensitization are the symptoms of stress, they conform to the usual pattern of stress symptoms. This pattern is set, limited, because nerves under stress always release the same chemicals, which act on the same organs and always produce the same results. It comforts a sufferer to learn that the pattern of his suffering is limited and that he has probably already experienced the severest symptoms his nerves can bring. I have seen this information alone cure some people. Because their body had brought them so many surprises in the past and had, as they thought, let them down so badly, they were constantly worried about what further surprises the future might yet hold.</p><p>HOW NERVES NORMALLY FUNCTION</p><p>When we say someone is suffering from nerves, we do not only mean nerves are stimulated to bring certain symptoms, but we also imply that nerves have &#x201c;gone wrong&#x201d; and are somehow at fault. Actually they are responding faithfully and physiologically to the messages sent to them. To be cured one should understand this, and to do so it is essential to know how nerves normally function. Although I described this in detail in my earlier book, Hope and Help for Your Nerves, it is necessary to repeat the description at least briefly here.</p><p>Our nervous system consists of two parts: voluntary and involuntary. By means of our voluntary nerves we move our muscles (hence our body) more or less as we wish. These nerves obey our direct command, so we call them voluntary. The involuntary nerves help our glands control the functioning of our organs&#x2014;heart, lungs, bowels, and so on. Unlike the voluntary nerves, we have (with a few exceptions) no direct control over them&#x2014;hence the term &#x201c;involuntary.&#x201d;</p><p>The involuntary nerves themselves consist of two divisions, sympathetic and parasympathetic. In a peaceful body these two hold each other in check. If we are emotional, however&#x2014;afraid, angry, excited, agitated&#x2014;the sympathetic usually dominates the parasympathetic, and we are aware of certain organs functioning: We may feel our heart race and pound, we may breathe quickly, our hands may sweat, and so on. Sympathetic nerves produce these reactions mainly by means of a chemical called adrenaline, which is released at the nerve endings in the organs concerned.</p><p>Normally when afraid, we accept our racing heart, rapid breathing, even the spasm of fear in our &#x201c;middle,&#x201d; because we know that when the cause of the fear goes, these reactions will also pass. Our feelings calm because we no longer think fearfully. Changing mood (attitude) is the only conscious control other than medication we have over our symptoms of stress. I emphasize this because understanding it is of paramount importance in understanding recovery from so much nervous illness.</p><p>BEWILDERMENT AND FEAR</p><p>Now I come to a point I wish to highlight: The symptoms of much nervous illness are no more than the symptoms of stress exaggerated by severe sensitization. One might well ask, What is the difference between severe sensitization and nervous illness? When do we say someone is merely sensitized and when nervously ill? And how does he pass from sensitization to nervous illness?</p><p>We say a person is nervously ill when sensitization upsets him so much that it interferes with his way of life. Someone who has never been sensitized might well then ask, What keeps a person sensitized long enough for this to happen? And this is a good question, because it brings us face to face with those other two culprits previously mentioned, bewilderment and fear.</p><p>Bewilderment and fear keep sensitization alive. Bewilderment acts by placing a sensitized person constantly under the strain of asking himself, What is wrong with me? Why am I like this? The more he struggles to be the person he was, the more exasperation, the more tension, and consequently the more stress he adds. His failure to find a way out of this maze makes him feel incapable of coping with any future course his illness might take, and he vaguely sees himself being &#x201c;taken away somewhere.&#x201d;</p><p>While he feels in his bewilderment that he cannot direct his thoughts and actions adequately, he stands especially vulnerable to, and defenseless before, fear, which can overwhelm him before he has time to reason with it. It is the stress of bewilderment and fear continually being added to the stress of the original sensitization that keeps this sensitization alive and keeps its symptoms so severe. The sensitized person puts himself in a cycle of fear-adrenaline-fear. In other words, his fear of the state he is in produces the adrenaline and other stress hormones, which continue to excite his nerves to produce the very symptoms he fears. The fear-adrenaline-fear cycle is also called an anxiety state.</p><p>So many of the people who have come to me for help have had no particular problem or no cause in their subconscious either creating their illnesses or keeping them ill. Their main difficulties were finding the way to recovery and trying to meet responsibilities that because of illness seemed beyond them. They had been tricked into illness by those three bogeys, sensitization, bewilderment, and fear.</p><p>THE HABIT OF FEAR</p><p>In my opinion, too much time is spent and too much suffering is caused today by unnecessary searching for deep-seated causes of nervous illness when so often none exist. It is not enough to be told that such and such happened when one was young and that this is why one is nervous now. Whatever may have originally caused the illness&#x2014;and in my experience it is by no means as often a childhood cause as is commonly believed&#x2014;present sensitization remains. The habit of fear is the important thing now. This must be cured.</p><p>A woman from America wrote:</p><p>I saw a doctor four years ago, but out of sheer frustration, I quit. He did nothing but continually rehash the past. All I seemed to hear was that my mother left me to the maids and my father didn&#x2019;t love me either. I have been told over and over again that lack of love caused my acute phobias, but never how to handle the fears themselves, especially fear of leaving home alone. I have repeatedly asked for help to deal with today, with the acute and constant fears and awful physical feelings I have. It seems all I&#x2019;ve been given to live with is &#x201c;but if&#x201d; and &#x201c;if only.&#x201d;</p><p>This is not an isolated cry. It comes from many. Until the importance of straightforward sensitization is recognized as a possible cause of nervous illness, our present rate of cure will not improve as much as it otherwise would. I stress again that so much nervous illness has no deep-seated cause and is no more than severe sensitization&#x2014;perhaps accidentally acquired&#x2014;kept alive by bewilderment and fear.</p><p>The nervously ill person is forever questioning not only himself but also others. Too often the answers are so unsatisfactory that he loses hope of ever finding the explanation he craves, especially if he has been ill for long. Should you be suffering like this, you need a full explanation of what is happening to you. You also need a program for recovery, and that is what I offer in this book.<br><br><b>2<br><br>Fear of Leaving the Safety of Home (Agoraphobia)</b></p><p>&#x201c;Agoraphobia&#x201d; literally means &#x201c;fear of the marketplace,&#x201d; an abnormal fear of being in open or public places. In medical practice it refers to fear of leaving the safety of home either alone or in company. It is a much more crippling fear than claustrophobia&#x2014;fear of enclosed places.</p><p>Until recently few people had heard of agoraphobia; even some doctors did not know the term. Four years ago, I accompanied a patient to see an ophthalmic surgeon of many years&#x2019; experience. I explained to him that the patient suffered with agoraphobia and mentioned the possible temporary effect of the tension on her vision. He listened politely, but when we were leaving, said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in this illness you call agoraphobia. It doesn&#x2019;t exist!&#x201d; Since then there has been much publicity in England about the housebound housewife (suffering from agoraphobia) in newspapers and magazines and on radio and television; I doubt if that surgeon would say the same today.</p><p>It is possible this particular phase of nervous illness received so little attention in the past because an agoraphobic person often feels too self-conscious about his fears to discuss them even with a doctor. It is not easy for a woman to confess, especially to a man who she thinks may be unbelieving (as was that surgeon), that she is afraid to go to the supermarket alone and must either take a child with her for protection or send the child to do the shopping. It is just as difficult for a man to explain that he prefers to stay in a subordinate position at work because he cannot face taking a higher position that would mean traveling from city to city when he finds it so difficult to leave his own town.</p><p>This fear is not only difficult to explain to others but also difficult for the sufferers to understand themselves. Most of them used not to be like this, and they look back now in amazement at how freely they could once travel. This is why they think their illness is peculiar, something to be ashamed of, and why they are so surprised when they learn that many sensible, even notable, people suffer just as they do. After I have spoken about agoraphobia on radio or television, the studio switchboard is frequently jammed with incoming calls from people who have heard themselves and their fears described for the first time. Acknowledgment that the origin of their illness could be simple, the detailed description of how they feel, and especially recognition of the importance of their fear of fear are the reassurance they had been wanting for so long and had despaired of finding.</p><p>THE SAFETY ZONE</p><p>The sufferer from agoraphobia does not really think some particular place holds a special danger for him and that something there will harm him. He is afraid of how he will react when in a certain situation. He has become so sensitively aware of what happens within himself at the slightest stress&#x2014;of how he panics, feels weak and giddy, and so on&#x2014;that he lives in fear that these feelings will arise in places where he thinks he will be unable to cope wit...</p></p><h2>Not Your Mother&#39;s Slow Cooker Cookbook</h2><p>You probably own a slow cooker - 80 percent of American households do. For more than thirty years, its unbeatable convenience and practicality have made it a staple of busy families, enabling anyone to return to a home-cooked meal at the end of a hectic day. Many slow cooker recipes, however, have relied on less-than-healthy convenience products. Now, Beth Hensperger and Julie Kaufmann&#39;s Not Your Mother&#39;sr Slow Cooker Cookbook takes a completely fresh look at cooking with this popular appliance. This comprehensive collection of 350 recipes combines the ease of slow cooking with the fresh, wholesome ingredients and exciting flavors of today&#39;s kitchen. For days when there&#39;s just no time for prep, there&#39;s Orange and Honey Chicken Drumsticks or Country Ribs with Onions, Apples, and Sauerkraut.

Stay out of the kitchen when guests arrive with Duck Breasts with Port Wine Sauce or wake up to breakfast with Hot Apple Granola Oatmeal. Hensperger and Kaufmann offer dishes for every time frame, without compromising on taste, quality, or variety. And Not Your Mother&#39;sr Slow Cooker Cookbook showcases the best of home cooking while taking advantage of a global melting pot of flavors - so cooks can serve Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya one day and Japanese Beef Curry Rice another. All the classic slow cooker recipes are here, plus many more adventuresome and innovative dishes.

This whopping collection of 350 recipes is reason enough to unearth that Crock-Pot from the attic or invest in one of the new high-tech models. The title, however, is a misnomer, and not just because the book includes a recipe for "Mom's Beef Stew." Much of what Hensperger (<i>The Bread Bible</i>) and Kaufmann (coauthor, with Hensperger, of <i>The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook</i>) present is exactly the kind of comfort food typically associated with childhood snow days or family gatherings. To use the word "hearty" in describing these recipes is to state the obvious. There are more than a dozen oatmeals and porridges, ranging from Cinnamon Apple Oatmeal to Creamy Cornmeal Porridge. Soups include Vegetarian Split Pea, French Onion, and White Bean with Bacon. Twenty-four types of baked beans are mere prelude for the 14 chili options, including "Senator Barry Goldwater's Arizona Chili" (which gives new meaning to the phrase "bowl of red"). Other recipes are for poultry, meat and fish dishes, and New and Old World dishes are plentiful. The only letdown is the "Not-from-the-Slow Cooker Accompaniments" chapter, with its uninspired choices like Baked Rice, and Mixed Green Salad. But the concluding pages, full of puddings and fruit desserts, atone with sinful treats like Chocolate Peanut Butter Pudding Cake and Rum-Butterscotch Bananas. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In an overlong effort, Golenbock (Fenway: An Unexpurgated History of the Boston Red Sox, 1992, etc.) competently reviews Martin's playing days in the 1950s and his drunken carousings with Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford. He brings insight into the father- son relationship he had with Casey Stengel and their eventual falling-out. And Golenbock does a good job of retracing Martin's managerial odyssey: AAA Denver in 1968; winning the division with the Minnesota Twins in 1969 and being fired after the playoffs; his turnaround of the Detroit Tigers in 1971, capped by taking the division the following season, and then dismissal after a tumultuous 1973; being named Manager of the Year in 1974 for resurrecting the hapless Texas Rangers only to be fired in July 1975; then, his achievement of a lifelong dream in being named to manage the New York Yankees. All the well-publicized hirings and firings (five times by the Yankees), the womanizing and bar brawls, and the ugly fights with George Steinbrenner, Reggie Jackson, Jim Brewer, and others are here. While any biography of Martin would have to include Steinbrenner, Golenbock uses an inordinate amount of space to go after the domineering, controversial Yankees owner (a ``weak, self-centered tyrant'' and ``a real jock sniffer''). Steinbrenner's youth and teen years at Culver Military Academy, etc., receive lengthier, more detailed attention than Martin's background and childhood. And in asides to his recounting of the messy details of the 1989 auto accident that killed Martin, Golenbock takes his widow, Jill--and Steinbrenner--to task for having ``killed his spirit'' and ``ruined his life.'' Much of this is a rehashing of the author's earlier books on the Yankees, but it will, nonetheless, stir up controversy by reopening old wounds. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The late Billy Martin was one of the most controversial figures in modern baseball history and one of the most mercurial. Golenbock, the best-selling author or coauthor of numerous, high-profile sports bios, coauthored Martin's autobiography, <i>Number 1</i>, in 1980 and believes this volume to be a kind of sequel to that earlier effort. Though Golenbock acknowledges early and often that most of Martin's problems stemmed from his ever-escalating alcoholism, the beleaguered manager is portrayed as the victim of egocentric players, owners, and wives. The vast majority of the book focuses on Martin's hate-hate relationship with New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, who hired and fired Martin five times. Steinbrenner will not be inviting Golenbock to any cocktail parties. The Yankee owner emerges here as an insecure egomaniac born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Steinbrenner, according to Golenbock, wanted to take credit for Martin's success and sought to humiliate his manager by planting "informed source" pieces in New York papers. Martin's temper--fueled by booze--would then erupt, and the battle would be on. Though Golenbock is obviously sympathetic to Martin, the overall impression here is of a life badly out of control. Provocative reading for Yankee fans. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Wind Rider&#39;s Oath (War God (Weber))</h2><p>Bahzell has managed to stop a war by convincing Baron Tellian, leader of the Sothoii, to surrender to him, the War God&#39;s champion.

He hates the war, yet is driven to come to terms with it. There is a pervading sense of dreamworld or hallucination, heightened by the device of passages written in a macaronic language, invented from multilingual roots, to satirize and parody political propaganda speeches dealing with the war. A work of imagination (Merton did not in fact return to England after the start of World War II in Europe), it nevertheless contains much that is autobiographical and revealing of the young Merton. Most clearly visible are the seeds of his never-forsaken concern with peace and nonviolence and his abhorrence of war. Indeed, his outspoken criticism of Britain at a time when all the emphasis was on 'the brave little island standing alone' foreshadows his devotion to truth as he saw it, no matter what the cost. And students of Merton will find scenes in the book that are straight autobiography, amplifying and perhaps filling in gaps in what later was to be the beginning of Merton's great literary success,&nbsp;The Seven Storey Mountain&nbsp;(1948).</p><p><strong>Thomas Merton</strong> (1915-1968) entered the Cistercian Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky, following his conversion to Catholicism and was ordained in 1949. During the 1960s, he was increasingly drawn into a dialogue between Eastern and Western religions and was actively engaged with domestic issues of war and racism.</p><h2>C. S.

Arresting and provocative . . . To say that Orhan Pamuk's new novel, <i>My Name is Red, </i>is a murder mystery is like saying that Dostoevsky's <i>The Brothers Karamazov </i> is a murder mystery: it is true, but the work so richly transcends the conventional limitations of genre as to make the definition seem almost irrelevant. . . . <i> </i>The techniques of classical Islamic literature are used to anchor the book within a tradition of local narrative, but they can also be used with a wonderfully witty and distancing lightness of touch . . .

Pamuk takes the reader into the strange and beautiful world of Islamic art,in which Western notions no longer make sense .... In this world of forgeries, where some might be in danger of losing their faith in literature, Pamuk is the real thing, and this book might well be one of the few recent works of fiction that will be remembered at the end of this century."<br>--Avkar Altinel, <i>The Observer</i>, UK<br><br>From one of the most important and acclaimed writers at work today, a thrilling new novel--part murder mystery, part love story--set amid the perils of religious repression in sixteenth-century Istanbul. <br>When the Sultan commissions a great book to celebrate his royal self and his extensive dominion, he directs Enishte Effendi to assemble a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style.

The only clue to the mystery--or crime?--lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Has an avenging angel discovered the blasphemous work? Or is a jealous contender for the hand of Enishte's ravishing daughter, the incomparable Shekure, somehow to blame? <br>Orhan Pamuk's "My Name Is Red is at once a fantasy and a philosophical puzzle, a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex, and power.</p><h2>The Origins of Major War (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs)</h2><p><p>One of the most important questions of human existence is what drives nations to war&#x2015;especially massive, system-threatening war. Much military history focuses on the who, when, and where of war; in this riveting book, Dale C. Copeland brings attention to bear on why governments make decisions that lead to, sustain, and intensify conflicts. Copeland presents detailed historical narratives of several twentieth-century cases, including World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. He highlights instigating factors that transcend individual personalities, styles of government, geography, and historical context to reveal remarkable consistency across several major wars usually considered dissimilar. The result is a series of challenges to established interpretive positions and provocative new readings of the causes of conflict.</p><p>Classical realists and neorealists claim that dominant powers initiate war. Hegemonic stability realists believe that wars are most often started by rising states. Copeland offers an approach stronger in explanatory power and predictive capacity than these three brands of realism: he examines not only the power resources but the shifting power differentials of states. He specifies more precisely the conditions under which state decline leads to conflict, drawing empirical support from the critical cases of the twentieth century as well as major wars spanning from ancient Greece to the Napoleonic Wars.</p></p><p>"This is an important and provocative piece of work. Copeland's fundamental argument about the extraordinary importance of the changing military balance is developed with great skill and intelligence, and his use of the historical sources was particularly impressive. This book is a wonderful example of international relations research at its best, and it is remarkably well-written to boot."--Marc Trachtenberg, University of California, Los Angeles, Author of A Constructed Peace <p>"In The Origins of Major War Dale Copeland presents an innovative theory of the causes of major war and provides powerful and sometimes provocative interpretations of the most important international crises of the twentieth century. This is a model of how to integrate theory and history in ways that enhance both, and is essential reading for all serious students of international conflict. "-- Jack S. Levy, Rutgers University </p><p>"Dale Copeland's The Origins of Major War is a superb book. Through a masterful blending of theoretical modeling and historical analysis, it sheds significant light on the manner in which changes in power relationships among countries may increase the risk of the outbreak of serious war. This book will be of great interest both to political scientists and historians, and it will help shape academic and policy-oriented thinking about the problem of shifts in national power and the prospects for world peace for many years to come."--Joseph Grieco, Duke University </p><p>"Dale Copeland establishes himself as one of the leading young international relations scholars with this truly important book, which offers a provocative and sweeping theory on the causes of great power war."--John J. Mearsheimer, University of Chicago</p><p>Dale C. Copeland is Associate Professor of International Relations in the Woodrow Wilson Department of Politics at the University of Virginia.

Towering figures - FDR, General Patton, King George VI, Marshal Tito, the Mountbattens - play significant roles in this fast-paced, enthralling story.<br>And there were lighter moments as well, notably in wartime London, where falling bombs took second place to frolics with old friends like Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, Noel Coward, and David Niven.<br>A Hell of a War colorfully ends with the return of the sailor to his wife and two daughters, Daphne and Victoria, to their California home, and their bizarre reception by the motion picture community, including Cary Grant, Barbara Hutton, and Fairbank's first wife, Joan Crawford: a fitting Hollywood finale to four years crammed with enough adventures to leave a screenwriter delightfully dizzy.</p><p>The follow-up to Fairbanks's first volume of memoirs (Salad Days, 1988) finds him as charming and debonair as ever and abrim with tales of his naval service during WW II. Born in 1909, Fairbanks is, of course, the son of movie swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks. Wisely, he reviews his first volume at length for those who haven't read it, and this proves a refreshing first course that sets up the reader for the author's hardships fighting his image as a glamour puss in uniform. With buddy and fellow-actor Robert Montgomery, Fairbanks enlists six months before the war, getting a Reserve commission from Secretary of the Navy Frank Know. Early duty as a deck officer finds him not only a greenhorn but green around the gills with mal de mer. He still moves among the famous when not at sea, being a great good friend of Lord Louis ``Dickie'' Mountbatten, who uses him as an ``American representative'' among the British in his Combined Operations staff for daring raids on Nazi-held Europe, with a grinning but inwardly foot-dragging Fairbanks slotted for amphibious landings. Many of Fairbanks's activities are quite exciting, especially on the beach at Anzio, or on board the US aircraft carrier Wasp, with planes making dangerous landings, or on convoy duty in the North Atlantic. During one run, the worst of the war, only 11 out of 35 merchant ships make it from the States into Russian ports. As for amusement, there's the showing of Fairbanks's last prewar film, The Corsican Brothers, on board the battleship Mississippi, attended by the ship's full company, thrilled and hooting, with Fairbanks red-faced throughout. Most satisfying, and a promised third volume should offer terrific dessert. (Sixteen pages of photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this second volume of his autobiography, following The Salad Days , the eminent actor covers his career as a U.S. naval officer from six weeks before Pearl Harbor to the end of WW II. Downplaying his military achievements (including a mission behind German lines in Italy and his earning a Silver Star), Fairbanks delights the reader with anecdotes about his struggles to maintain a low profile, carry out his duties and convince military colleagues that he was not simply a rich, spoiled son-of-a-movie-star movie star. His evocative recollections of wartime Washington and London include tales of romps with such "fine old chums" as Noel Coward, David Niven, Laurence Olivier and Marlene Dietrich, plus encounters with President and Mrs. Roosevelt. Readers will look forward to the next installment of these elegantly written, witty and warmly entertaining memoirs.

The uptimers and their allies take on the Ottoman Empire at its height of power.<br><br>The modern West Virginia town of Grantville has been displaced in time to continental Europe in 1632. Now four years have passed. The long-feared attack on Austria by the Ottoman Empire has begun. Armed with new weapons inspired by the time-displaced Americans of Grantville, the Turks are determined to do what they were unable to do in the universe the Americans came from: capture Vienna.<br> <br> The Ottomans have the advantage of being able to study the failings and errors of their own campaigns in a future they can now avoid. They are led by the young, dynamic, and ruthless Murad IV, the most capable emperor the Ottomans have produced in a century. They are equipped with weapons that would have seemed fantastical to the Turks of that other universe: airships, breech-loading rifles, rockets&#x2014;even primitive tanks.<br> <br> And this time they won&#x2019;t have to face massive reinforcements from Austria&#x2019;s allies. In fact, the only force Emperor Gustav Adolf can think of sending to Austria is the United States of Europe Third Division under the command of Mike Stearns. It&#x2019;s an army currently engaged in a desperate struggle for Bavaria.<br> <br> The emperors of the USE and Austria share the same problem. They have one too many enemies, one too few allies, and only one general to cover the gaps. Fortunately, that general is Mike Stearns, also known as the Prince of Germany.&nbsp;<br> <br> <b>About&nbsp;<i>1635: A Parcel of Rogues</i>:</b><br> "The 20th volume in this popular, fast-paced alternative history series follows close on the heels of the events in&nbsp;<i>The Baltic War</i>, picking up with the protagonists in London, including sharpshooter Julie Sims.

MacLean must surely be the outstanding, and most indefatigable, traveller-writer of our time' John le Carr</b><b>�</b></p><p>In 1989 the Berlin Wall fell. In that euphoric year Rory MacLean travelled from Berlin to Moscow, exploring lands that were &#x2013; for most Brits and Americans &#x2013; part of the forgotten half of Europe. Thirty years on, MacLean traces his original journey backwards, across countries confronting old ghosts and new fears: from revanchist Russia, through Ukraine's bloodlands, into illiberal Hungary, and then Poland, Germany and the UK. Along the way he shoulders an AK-47 to go hunting with Moscow's chicken Tsar, plays video games in St Petersburg with a cyber-hacker who cracked the US election, drops by the Che Guevara High School of Political Leadership in a non-existent nowhereland and meets the Warsaw doctor who tried to stop a march of 70,000 nationalists. Finally, on the shores of Lake Geneva, he waits patiently to chat with Mikhail Gorbachev.</p><p>As Europe sleepwalks into a perilous new age, MacLean explores how opportunists &#x2013; both within and outside of Russia, from Putin to Home Counties populists &#x2013; have made a joke of truth, exploiting refugees and the dispossessed, and examines the veracity of historical narrative from reportage to fiction and fake news. He asks what happened to the optimism of 1989 and, in the shadow of Brexit, chronicles the collapse of the European dream.</p></p><p>Rory MacLean is one of Britain's most expressive and adventurous travel writers. His books &#x2013; which have been translated into a dozen languages &#x2013; include the <i>Sunday Times </i>bestseller <i>Stalin's Nose,</i> <i>Under the Dragon</i> and <i>Berlin: Imagine a City</i>, which was named a Book of the Year by the <i>Washington Post.</i><p>&#x201c;[A] gripping book, part-travelogue, part contemporary history of Europe ...

She observed him: the dark, sweaty hair by his temples, the trembling eyelids, given a violet-red hue by the first morning light, and the beard stubble&#x2014;&#x201c;my scourge,&#x201d; he said, as he always had to shave&#x2014;which had scratched her. <br>He was not a powerful man, not much taller than she was, with a boyish body that made him look younger than almost forty-four. From his navel down to his pubic hair a dark, curly strand ran that resembled an exclamation point. <br>His face was thin and lacked strong lines, although when he smiled it came to life. Maybe it was his casual manner that first aroused her interest. Later, when she got to know him better, the picture got more complicated. He was just different in that way, often carefree and a little roguish, but with an inner fervor that was sometimes seen in his eyes and his gesturing hands. Then he was anything but carefree. As she observed his relaxed facial features, it occurred to her that his attitude reminded her of Sammy Nilsson, the one colleague she could confide in and discuss things other than the trivialities of work. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said, in a tone more ominous than she intended, now feeling even more banal. <br>But perhaps he understood: She was in love. Until now neither of them had hinted at anything like that. <br>And was that good? He was different in every conceivable way from the men she&#x2019;d been with. There weren&#x2019;t many really, two somewhat longer relationships&#x2014;Rolf and Edvard&#x2014;and a few short-lived ones, but the few weeks with Anders Brant had really shaken her up. <br>For the first time in a very long while she felt desired. He made no secret of his longing for her. He might call her at work and whisper things on the phone that left her speechless, and then when they met he drew her to him; despite his slender body his hands felt powerful. Sometimes she warded him off, afraid that Erik would surprise them, and also afraid of the rush she felt in her body, as if they were doing something forbidden. <br>&#x201c;Hugging won&#x2019;t hurt you,&#x201d; he would say. &#x201c;Relax.&#x201d; <br>He courted her, and he talked; never had Ann&#x2019;s apartment been filled with so many words. Talk, but never about before and later, always about the present. Unwilling to offer details about his past, not a word about his plans or dreams. <br>Ann knew absolutely nothing about his family, other than that he was the oldest of four children, and that his mother lived somewhere in south Sweden. His father had left early on; it was unclear whether he was alive. When she asked he simply mumbled something about &#x201c;the old man was too damn gloomy.&#x201d; <br>Few things surprised him. He noted her own biographical details without showing any great interest, and did not connect her experiences to scenes from his own life. <br>He showed the greatest interest and engagement when they were watching the evening news together. Then he sometimes got agitated, or cynically scornful. Journalist colleagues that he thought were not doing their job gave rise to derisive, in some cases spiteful, comments. <br>Despite this singular apathy with regards to the private sphere, he was present; she never felt bored or overlooked. He glided into her life without a lot of fuss. She liked that. She thought the contrast to her life, so heavily scheduled for so long, would have been too great if he broke out in impassioned declarations of love and constructed romantic castles in the air. <br>It was as if he took it for granted that they would be together. <br>Sometimes she noticed a certain restlessness in him. He would fall silent, lose focus, and almost be dismissive, even if he did not verbalize his irritation. On a few occasions he left her on the couch or at the kitchen table and went out on the balcony. Those were the only times she saw him smoke, slender cigarillos that he enjoyed with eyes closed, leaning back in the wicker chair she once got as a present from Edvard. Then he wanted to be alone, she realized that. <br>After smoking his cigarillo he always brushed his teeth, which she also appreciated. <br>&#x201c;I have to leave,&#x201d; he said, abruptly interrupting her thoughts. &#x201c;I may be gone a week or two.&#x201d; <br>He got up from the bed, hurriedly dressed, and left. <br>&#x2014;K, 31 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2008 by Kjell Eriksson <br>Translation � 2014 by Paul Norlen <br></p><h2>Benjamin Franklin</h2><p>In this outstanding picture book biography,&nbsp;&nbsp;first-time readers will meet one of America's most&nbsp;&nbsp;extraordinary historical figures.

Ingri Mortenson and Edgar Parin D'Aulaire met in Munich where both were studying art in the 1920's. Ingri had grown up in Norway; Edgar, the son of a noted portrait painter, was born in Switzerland and had lived in Paris and Florence. Shortly after their marriage, they moved to the United States and began to create the picture books that have established their reputation for unique craftsmanship. Their books were known for their vivid lasting color. a result of the pain-staking process of stone lithography used for all their American history biographies. This was an old world craft in which they were both expert, which involved actually tracing their images on large slabs of Bavarian limestone. Throughout their long careers, Ingri and Edgar worked as a team on both art and text. Their research took them to the actual places of their biographies, including the countries of Italy, Portugal and Spain when they were researching <i>Columbus</i>; to the hills of Virginia while they researched Washington; and to the wilds of Kentucky and Illinois for <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>, winner of the Caldecott Medal. The fact that they spoke 5 languages fluently served them well in their European travels and in their research of original documents.

This is because 28-year-old Chris has xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)&#x2014;a light-sensitivity so severe that he cannot leave his house in daylight, cannot enter a normally-lit room, cannot sit at a computer. Chris's natural element is the night, and his parents, both academics, chose to live in Moonlight Bay because in a small town Chris can make the nightscape his own&#x2014;roaming freely through the town on his bike, surfing in the moonlight, exploring while most people sleep.<br><br>But Chris's brilliant mother, a scientist, was killed in a car accident 2 years ago, and as the book opens his father, Steven Snow, is dying of cancer; Chris's protected life is about to change forever. We meet Chris as he is carefully preparing himself to go out in the late-afternoon sun to visit the hospital. In his last moments of life his father tells Chris he is "sorry" and that Chris should "fear nothing"&#x2014;cryptic words that Chris cannot really relate to.<br><br>Steven Snow's body is removed to the hospital basement for transport to the funeral home/crematorium, and when Chris goes downstairs for a final moment of farewell, he witnesses a frightening and clandestine encounter: the funeral director and another man Chris doesn't recognize are substituting the body of a hitchhiker for Steven Snow's body&#x2013;which is being taken not to the crematorium but to some secret destination.<br><br>For Chris, this scene is the first intimation of a conspiracy that he will come to realize envelopes many of his townspeople. His parents knew of it and wanted to protect Chris from it. His best friend has had hints of something wrong because of the frightening nocturnal visitors that have come to his beachhouse. And the first person to try to explain to Chris what's going on&#x2014;and warn him about the special danger he himself is in&#x2014;will be hideously murdered.<br><br>In the 24 hours this book encompasses, Christopher Snow will find out that, sheltered though he's been, he has the soul of a fighter and an adventurer. By the end of the book he will have killed a man, will have discovered the role his own mother played in the birth of the conspiracy, will have come to recognize the extraordinary guardians that, unknown to him, have watched over him for years. He will realize that some people hate him, others revere him, and neither his own life nor those of anyone he knows will ever be the same.</p><p>If you think you've got it tough, meet Christopher Snow, the hero of Dean Koontz's novel <i>Fear Nothing</i>. Not only did his parents die under mysterious circumstances, but he's also being stalked by shadowy characters who want Snow to stop trying to find out how they died--or else they'll bump off his remaining loved ones (his supersmart, beer-lapping dog Orson; his best surfing buddy Bobby; and his late-night deejay girlfriend Sasha). And as if being on the lam in his own hometown, Moonlight Bay, California, isn't bad enough, Snow has to outrun his pursuers without leaving town. He has XP--xeroderma pigmentosum--a rare genetic affliction that forces him to avoid light. Cumulative exposure to sun, fluorescent lights, and the like will give him cancer eventually, and he doesn't dare leave the place where he's skillfully "done the mambo with melanoma" for all of his 28 years. Koontz makes the night-town of Moonlight Bay come alive in this sometimes pulse-pounding, sometimes funny, but mostly rather lyrical thriller. Fans of Koontz's legendary 1986 novel <i>Watchers</i> will love this book's similar theme: our hero and a loveable super-dog deal with a genetic engineering laboratory run amok. Horror fans will savor the evil mutant rhesus "millennium monkeys" who hunt Snow, the few scenes of eloquent gore, and the plight of certain mutating townsfolk who are, as they put it, "becoming" something very creepy. <p> Koontz gives Snow and Bobby a lingo that does for surfer talk what Austin Powers did for the Swinging '60s, and his metaphors are almost as madcap as Tom Robbins's: "As the chains of the swinging light fixture torqued, the links twisted against one another with enough friction to cause an eerie ringing, as if lizard-eyed altar boys in blood-soaked cassocks and surplices were ringing the unmelodious bells of a satanic mass." Sometimes Koontz's style goes over the top and wipes out, surfer-style, but for the most part, <i>Fear Nothing</i> will have readers bellowing "Cowabunga!"</p><br></p><h2>Malafrena</h2><p>In the land of Orsinia, Itale Sorde, heir to the beautiful Malafrena Valley, becomes a member of a revolutionary group and moves to the city of Krasnoy, forsaking Malafrena</p><p>Ursula K.

By investigating the interest Washington&#39;s contemporaries had in him, and by playing that interest off against some of the perennial problems of political morality and the uses of power, Wills gives us a fresh perspective on our first President. [He] shows how Washington solved the problem of charismatic leadership by embodying the eighteenth-century Enlightenment idea: the creation of a revived classical republic. People responded to such leadership in verse, sermons, songs, paintings, and sculpture. This book differs from other historical studies of political power by its use of evidence from a wide range of sources. In Wills&#39;s hands art history becomes a new kind of political science. [He] finds forgotten messages in Parson Weems&#39;s account of Washington; he traces the use of classical images to such unsuspected places as the carving of American eagles and the disposition of Washington&#39;s hands in Greenough&#39;s notorious statue of the first President. The great actions of Washington are seen afresh, as in a restored painting: the surrender of his military commission, his Farewell Address, and his indispensable role in the ratification of the Constitution of the United States.&#34; From front and back flaps.</p><p></p><h2>Sorcerers of Majipoor (Prestimion Trilogy)</h2><p>On the gigantic planet Majipoor, it is a time of ancient mysteries and new wonders. The aged Pontifex Prankipin, who brought sorcery (and prosperity) to the Fifty Cities of Castle Mount, is at last near death. Omens are seen, prodigies are born, wine and blood are consumed...even the sea-dragons have been glimpsed from the cliffs. Truly, a great change is at hand!<br>The Coronal Lord Confalume, who will become Pontifex, decides to begin the Funeral Games before his own replacement is chosen. It is no secret that the next Coronal will be Prince Prestimion. By law and custom, the blood son of the present Coronal cannot rule the seemingly endless castle with its 30,000 rooms. Besides, everyone knows that young Korsibar is an outdoorsman, preferring the pleasures of the hunt to the intrigues of the court.<br>What everyone does not know is that the hunter has a new and secret quarry - the Starburst Crown. Korsibar has been visited by an oracle. From the thin lips of the two-headed Su-Suheris, he has heard the whispered words that will plunge the planet into a fearsome conflagration, engulfing all the myriad races of Majipoor in a war to alter destiny itself.</p><p>Robert Silverberg's many novels include the bestselling Lord Valentine trilogy and the classics <i>Dying Inside</i> and <i>A Time of Changes.</i> He has been nominated for the Nebula and Hugo awards more times than any other writer, he is a five-time winner of the Nebula and a four-time winner of the Hugo.Another of veteran Silverberg's yarns set on Majipoor, the giant planet inhabited--for the most part amicably--by humans along with a bewildering array of aliens (The Mountains of Majipoor, 1995, etc.). In an era when sorcery dominates the councils and deeds of the mighty, the ancient Pontifex, Prankipin, lies dying. According to ancient tradition, his successor will be Lord Confalume, the present Coronal. But there is great rivalry between Prince Prestimion, expected to be named Coronal after Confalume, and Confalume's son Korsibar--the latter of whom, an oracle has told, ``will shake the world.'' Korsibar's sister, the ambitious Thismet, is also ``destined for greatness,'' again according to an oracle. But Prankipin takes so long to die that Prestimion and Korsibar agree to inaugurate his Funeral Games before he actually expires. Meanwhile, the sorcerers and Thismet persuade Korsibar that his claim to become Coronal is stronger than Prestimion's, thus precipitating a plot to usurp the prince. The upshot is a sorcery-inspired civil war so terrible that the victor orders the sorcerers to wipe its memory from history and from the minds of the people. Nearly 500 pages of elegant, soporific twiddling; even Majipoor addicts are likely to find their attention wandering. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Like her, Patrick Edward is fearless: When bullies taunt him (``Your mother wears army boots'') and tie him up, he bursts his bonds and breaks their baseball bat. His mighty roar summons Mama, who chases the bullies home to make a new cake to replace the one they've just destroyed. The cake is shared; Mama gives Patrick Edward a hug (``I am your mother, even if I am a monster--and I love you''); and the admiring boys depart, remarking, ``Your mother is something else.'' Sendak's Wild Things embody a child's inner life; here, parents' mysterious, often scary vagaries are personified by an extraordinary mother who is unpredictable, even fierce, but also creative, nurturing, and the source of her child's strength. Gammell's vibrant, freely rendered paintings magnify the ambivalence: clouds of dark lurk behind pervasive splashes of brilliant color; unkempt Mama, with hairy arms and pointy, multicolored fingernails, is almost terrifyingly bizarre; but the sturdy boy with his shock of tangerine hair is clearly a secure little person who can handle whatever life brings. This is not for the literal-minded: those who read the thematic title as an oxymoron may also feel challenged by the gorgeous, if unconventional, art. A splendid book that reaches deep into truth, not all of it cozy, and comes up smiling. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Kindergarten-Grade 2-- "Patrick Edward was a wonderful boy, but his mother was a monster. She lived in a big cave at the back of the house." She may be a monster, yet she has a sweet touch where her son is concerned. She teaches him lots of things and is always there when he needs her most. The nicely paced text maintains the balance between the offbeat and the commonplace. Despite the book's brevity, the characters of both Patrick Edward, a self-sufficient, fearless little boy, and his mother, who is shy and retiring except when roused by necessity, emerge clearly. Gammell's cheery palette and loose, fluid watercolors succeed admirably in creating an atmosphere of mystery and charm. Figures emerge out of multilayer swirls of color, sometimes defined, sometimes just impressionistic, yet recognizable, shapes. Mama is shape-shifting monstrous, but the bright shades of green, yellow, blue, and purple, and the generally benign expressions, make her interesting rather than threatening. The story has humor, suspense, and just a hint of magic to beguile readers. It also has universal appeal as it portrays a warm, supportive relationship between a son and his unique, yet loving, mother. --Karen James, Louisville Free Public Library, KY<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book of Blessings: New Jewish Prayers for Daily Life, the Sabbath, and the New Moon Festival</h2><p>The Book of Blessings is an extraordinary and deeply poetic re-creation of Jewish prayer that offers new blessings, poems, and meditations for Sabbath, holiday, and everyday observance.

My first trip, I was a wild brainless kid of course, learning the hard way by rambunctious adventure, the needs to explore the unknown, down the plunging rapids. The Rogue is a wild brawling river and you had better respect it. I learned to use the oars, the pikepole, rope line, currents and eddies, and how to read the water. I craved fast white water like a steelhead, and tried lots of rivers like the Klamath, the Salmon River of No Return, Canadian rivers, etc., but for me the Rogue beats them all. Later I hauled dudes... hundreds of them... maybe over a thousand, shooting the rapids and camping out on the beach in the wilds.&#34; These stories and many more are in this no-holds-barred book. But more than that, it tells of the Rogue itself, of its development and its people. It gives you a sense of an earlier time - a time whose only remnants are rusting pieces of mining equipment, fiant traces of burned cabins and crumbling bridge piers. It brings alive the grizzled miners always looking to strike it rich tomorrow; hermits toting rifles after the ultimate game, each other; tall-tale tellers; poachers and gamewardens; fueders, gillnetters, sportsmen and unsportsmen. It tells of blasting the channel downriver, of floods and rescues, of depression and river-running highs.</p><p></p><h2>The Poetry of Derek Walcott 1948-2013</h2><p><p><b>A collection spanning the whole of Derek Walcott's celebrated, inimitable, essential career </b><br><b></b><br><b></b>"He gives us more than himself or &#x2018;a world'; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language." Alongside Joseph Brodsky's words of praise one might mention the more concrete honors that the renowned poet Derek Walcott has received: a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship; the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry; the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br> <i>The Poetry of Derek Walcott 1948</i>&#x2013;<i>2013</i> draws from every stage of the poet's storied career. Here are examples of his very earliest work, like "In My Eighteenth Year," published when the poet himself was still a teenager; his first widely celebrated verse, like "A Far Cry from Africa," which speaks of violence, of loyalties divided in one's very blood; his mature work, like "The Schooner Flight" from <i>The Star-Apple Kingdom</i>; and his late masterpieces, like the tender "Sixty Years After," from the 2010 collection <i>White Egrets.</i><br><i> </i>Across sixty-five years, Walcott grapples with the themes that have defined his work as they have defined his life: the unsolvable riddle of identity; the painful legacy of colonialism on his native Caribbean island of St. Lucia; the mysteries of faith and love and the natural world; the Western canon, celebrated and problematic; the trauma of growing old, of losing friends, family, one's own memory. This collection, selected by Walcott's friend the English poet Glyn Maxwell, will prove as enduring as the questions, the passions, that have driven Walcott to write for more than half a century.</p></p><p><p><b>Derek Walcott (1930-2017)</b> was born in St. Lucia, the West Indies, in 1930. His <i>Collected Poems: 1948-1984</i> was published in 1986, and his subsequent works include a book-length poem, <i>Omeros </i>(1990); a collection of verse, <i>The Bounty</i> (1997); and, in an edition illustrated with his own paintings, the long poem <i>Tiepolo's Hound</i> (2000). His numerous plays include <i>The Haitian Trilogy</i> (2001) and <i>Walker and The Ghost Dance</i> (2002). Walcott received the Queen's Medal for Poetry in 1988 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992. </p><p><b>Glyn Maxwell</b> was born in Welwyn Garden City, England. He is the author of several collections of poems, has staged several plays in London and New York, and was the poetry editor of <i>The New Republic</i> from 2001 to 2007. He lives in London.</p><p>&#x201c;Derek Walcott is a natural poet. Walcott, who turned 84 this year, began writing young. His first poem appeared in a local paper when he was 14, and his first volume, <i>25 Poems</i>, was self-published when he was 18. &#x2018;Everyone wants a prodigy to fail,' Rita Dove wrote. &#x2018;It makes our mediocrity more bearable.' Walcott did not fail . . . &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Teju Cole, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Poetry of Derek Walcott</i> . . . [is] a rich and beautiful new selection of [Walcott's] life's work, edited by Glyn Maxwell . . . Language becomes a means of mastering his surroundings, enabling him to gain an almost magical power over the elements; language is more real to him than reality itself . . . These magician's powers are rare enough in twentieth-century poetry. But what is even rarer than the ability is the desire to write, as Walcott does, with such abundance and felicity . . .&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Kirsch, The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Few poets can sustain a collection spanning more than 600 pages and weighing over a kilo. Derek Walcott is one of the rare exceptions, and this is his most comprehensive anthology so far. Covering nearly seven decades, it is testament to an extraordinary talent . . .&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;One important element of Walcott's poetry is that it's a political poetry of the anti-repressive variety. He turns what might have been natural contempt for the European marauder into exotic kind of inclusiveness. As a Caribbean man, Walcott's self-awareness--that is to say, his use of traditional poetic meters inherited from English models--helps him, over time, to produce an art that is absolute and unassailable . . ." &#x2015;<i>David Biespiel, The Rumpus</i></p><p>&#x201c;Walcott is a generous writer in every sense. The expansive, celebratory texture of his verse is instantly recognisable. It moves with ease between city and country, between &#x2018;the snow still falling in white words on Eighth Street' and the way &#x2018;Sunshine [...] stirs the splayed shadows of the hills like moths' . . .&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Fiona Sampson, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;Walcott is a poet we're lucky to have writing. He is someone who has devoted his working life to art, in many senses--art as culture, art as craft and even art on canvas . . . the joy of Walcott's work is that even when he's at his most rambling, he isn't tedious. Taken as a whole, this collection gives us a kind of narrative &#x2013; the story of a poet who is developing even in his eighties, sustained by faith in what poetic forms can do, and the many ways in which those forms can do it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tom Payne, The Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;From his earliest poems--such as &#x2018;In My Eighteenth Year,' written when he was that age -- Walcott's voice is unornamented but carries a profound moral authority. His style is a synthesis of the influences that made the island: equal parts Shakespeare and slang. Walcott speaks ever as an outsider; the closest he gets to belonging is when he speaks for a country that is no one country . . .'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Craig Morgan Teicher, NPR</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Walcott's] is an associative, rich and elemental view of the world; with each new book, he stakes an ever-wider claim to authority.

They both live in Colorado.<br>In this homemaker's equivalent to The One-Minute Manager, the authors set out a system whereby a month's worth of family dinners can be cooked and frozen in one day, ready to microwave or reheat in a conventional oven whenever needed. Their step-by-step advice on assembling a shopping list, consolidating tasks such as chopping vegetables, grating cheese, browning meat, etc., undoubtedly saves time in making the stews, casseroles, chili and ham loaves with which they illustrate their points. But then the reader has side dishes to consider, as well as the inconvenience of flipping back and forth between what are essentially ho-hum recipes.

Based on nearly two decades of buying, selling, pursuing, and researching Molesworth furniture, Terry Winchell has created a definitive book that covers all spectrums of Molesworth's work, including the influence of the other artists who made his style unique, as well as stylistically and financially successful. The fact that Molesworth's furniture career spanned thirty-plus years speaks for itself. An excellent guide for collectors of Molesworth's work, this book is also an invaluable resource for fans of the Western Design movement. <br> Just as Gustav Stickley was influenced by John Ruskin and William Morris, Molesworth was certainly influenced by the Stickleys and others in the Arts and Crafts movement. Molesworth's early training at the Art Institute of Chicago as well as the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement are apparent in the simplicity and balance of his designs--yet he went a step further by using silhouettes, bright colors, and Native American motifs to personalize his efforts. He was not satisfied to stop there, however.

As the first thoroughly detailed and complete guide, it explores Molesworth's journey to becoming one of the leading western furniture designers. Molesworth's innovative designs-his sense of balance, simplicity, and artfulness-are visible in all of his efforts. In addition to furniture, he designed lighting, floor treatments, and art to complete his concept of a true western space. Molesworth also used silhouettes, bright colors, and incorporated Native American artifacts and motifs to personalize his work. Found in hotels and other public buildings, ranches, and homes, Molesworth's quality craftsmanship and superior use of materials are immediately recognizable. While his high-style work centers around practical rustic furniture pieces, at the heart of his work the romantic and enduring spirit of the West is manifest and experienced. A guide for Thomas Molesworth devotees as well as aficionados of western design, this definitive volume details Molesworth's education, the early years of his career, and the founding and establishment of his Shoshone Furniture Company. Molesworth was incredibly successful at producing world-class furniture and developing lucrative marketing strategies from coast-to-coast. His influence on his hometown of Cody, Wyoming, and the colony of artists he inspired is immeasurable. With a career spanning over thirty years, his influence is profound and sweeping. Indeed, that influence extends into today where a new generation of artists and collectors are dazzled and inspired by Molesworth's legacy. Flip through the pages of this book to rediscover your love affair with the West and learn more about this visionary designer, craftsman, and western dreamer. back flap Terry Winchell has dealt antiques for nearly two and a half decades as owner of Fighting Bear Antiques in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Illness prevented him from bringing his version of the <i>Iliad</i> to completion, but enough survives in notebooks and letters to assemble a compilation that includes the previously published volumes <i>War Music</i>, <i>Kings</i>, <i>The Husbands</i>, <i>All Day Permanent Red</i>, and <i>Cold Calls</i>, along with previously unpublished material, in one final illuminating volume arranged by his friend and fellow poet Christopher Reid. The result, <i>War Music</i>, comes as near as possible to representing the poet&#x2019;s complete vision and confirms what his admirers have long known: that &#x201c;<i>Logue&#x2019;s Homer</i> is likely to endure as one of the great long poems of the twentieth century&#x201d; (<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>).</p></p><p><b>Christopher Logue</b> (1926&#x2013;2011), poet, playwright, scriptwriter, and actor, was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire.

Anything bad that could happen had happened. A woman had not told them about an allergy and had come out with lumps and a rash on her forehead. A bride&#x2019;s mother had thrown a tantrum and said that she looked like a laughingstock. A man who had wanted streaks of blond in his hair became apoplectic when, halfway through the process, he had inquired what they would cost. Katie&#x2019;s husband, Garry, had placed both his hands innocently on the shoulders of a sixty-year-old female client, who had then told him that she was going to sue him for sexual harassment and assault.<br><br>Katie looked now at the man standing opposite her, a big priest with sandy hair mixed with gray.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Katie Finglas and I gather you run this establishment,&#x201d; the priest said, looking around the innocent salon nervously as if it were a high-class brothel.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Father,&#x201d; Katie said with a sigh. What could be happening now?<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I was talking to some of the girls who work here, down at the center on the quays, you know, and they were telling me . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Katie felt very tired. She employed a couple of high school dropouts: she paid them properly, trained them. What could they have been complaining about to a priest?<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Father, what exactly is the problem?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it is a bit of a problem. I thought I should come to you directly, as it were.&#x201d; He seemed a little awkward.<br><br>&#x201c;Very right, Father,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;So tell me what it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s this woman, Stella Dixon. She&#x2019;s in hospital, you see . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hospital?&#x201d; Katie&#x2019;s head reeled. What <i>could</i> this involve? Someone who had inhaled the peroxide?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that.&#x201d; She tried for a level voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but she wants a hairdo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean she trusts us again?&#x201d; Sometimes life was extraordinary.<br><br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think she was ever here before. . . .&#x201d; He looked bewildered.<br><br>&#x201c;And your interest in all this, Father?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am Brian Flynn and I am acting chaplain at St. Brigid&#x2019;s Hospital at the moment, while the real chaplain is in Rome on a pilgrimage. Apart from being asked to bring in cigarettes and drink for the patients, this is the only serious request I&#x2019;ve had.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You want me to go and do someone&#x2019;s hair in hospital?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s seriously ill. She&#x2019;s dying. I thought she needed a senior person to talk to. Not, of course, that you look very senior. You&#x2019;re only a girl yourself,&#x201d; the priest said.<br><br>&#x201c;God, weren&#x2019;t you a sad loss to the women of Ireland when you went for the priesthood,&#x201d; Katie said. &#x201c;Give me her details and I&#x2019;ll bring my magic bag of tricks in to see her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you so much. I have it all written out here.&#x201d; Father Flynn handed her a note.<br><br>A middle-aged woman approached the desk. She had glasses on the tip of her nose and an anxious expression.<br><br>&#x201c;I gather you teach people the tricks of hairdressing,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, or more the <i>art </i>of hairdressing, as we like to call it,&#x201d; Katie said.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a cousin coming home from America for a few weeks. She mentioned that in America there are places where you could get your hair done for near to nothing cost if you were letting people practice on you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we do have a students&#x2019; night on Tuesdays; people bring in their own towels and we give them a style. They usually contribute five euros to a charity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tonight is Tuesday!&#x201d; the woman cried triumphantly.<br><br>&#x201c;So it is,&#x201d; Katie said through gritted teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;So, could I book myself in? I&#x2019;m Josie Lynch.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great, Mrs. Lynch&#x2014;see you after seven o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; Katie said, writing down the name. Her eyes met the priest&#x2019;s. There was sympathy and understanding there.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t all champagne and glitter running your own hairdressing salon.<br><br>Josie and Charles Lynch had lived in 23 St. Jarlath&#x2019;s Crescent since they were married thirty-two years ago. They had seen many changes in the area. The corner shop had become a mini-supermarket; the old laundry, where sheets had been ironed and folded, was now a Laundromat, where people left big bags bulky with mixed clothes and asked for a service wash. There was now a proper medical practice with four doctors where once there had been just old Dr. Gillespie, who had brought everyone into the world and seen them out of it.<br><br>During the height of the economic boom, houses in St. Jarlath&#x2019;s Crescent had changed hands for amazing sums of money. Small houses with gardens near the city center had been much in demand. Not anymore, of course&#x2014;the recession had been a great equalizer, but it was still a much more substantial area than it had been three decades ago.<br><br>After all, just look at Molly and Paddy Carroll, with their son Declan&#x2014;a doctor&#x2014;a real, qualified doctor! And just look at Muttie and Lizzie Scarlet&#x2019;s daughter Cathy. She ran a catering company that was hired for top events.<br><br>But a lot of things had changed for the worse. There was no community spirit anymore. No church processions went up and down the Crescent on the feast of Corpus Christi, as they used to three decades ago. Josie and Charles Lynch felt that they were alone in the world, and certainly in St. Jarlath&#x2019;s Crescent, in that they knelt down at night and said the Rosary.<br><br>That had always been the way.<br><br>When they married they planned a life based on the maxim that the family that prays together stays together. They had assumed they would have eight or nine children, because God never put a mouth into this world that He didn&#x2019;t feed. But that wasn&#x2019;t to happen. After Noel, Josie had been told there would be no more children. It was hard to accept. They both came from big families; their brothers and sisters had produced big families. But then, perhaps, it was all meant to be this way.<br><br>They had always hoped Noel would be a priest. The fund to educate him for the priesthood was started before he was three. Money was put aside from Josie&#x2019;s wages at the biscuit factory. Every week a little more was added to the post office savings account, and when Charles got his envelope on a Friday from the hotel where he was a porter, a sum was also put into the post office. Noel would get the best of priestly educations when the time came.<br><br>So it was with great surprise and a lot of disappointment that Josie and Charles learned that their quiet son had no interest whatsoever in a religious life. The Brothers said that he showed no sign of a vocation, and when the matter had been presented to Noel as a possibility when he was fourteen, he had said if it was the last job on earth he wouldn&#x2019;t go for it.<br><br>That had been very definite indeed.<br><br>Not so definite, however, was what he actually <i>would </i>like to do. Noel was vague about this, except to say he might like to run an office. Not work in an office, but run one. He showed no interest in studying office management or bookkeeping or accounting or in any areas where the careers department tried to direct him. He liked art, he said, but he didn&#x2019;t want to paint. If pushed, he would say that he liked looking at paintings and thinking about them. He was good at drawing; he always had a notebook and a pencil with him and he was often to be found curled up in a corner sketching a face or an animal. This did not, of course, lead to any career path, but Noel had never expected it to. He did his homework at the kitchen table, sighing now and then, but rarely ever excited or enthusiastic. At the parent-teacher meetings Josie and Charles had inquired about this. They wondered, Did anything at school fire him up? Anything at all?<br><br>The teachers were at a loss. Most boys were unfathomable around fourteen or fifteen but they had usually settled down to do something. Or often to do nothing. Noel Lynch, they said, had just become even more quiet and withdrawn than he already was.<br><br>Josie and Charles wondered, Could this be right?<br><br>Noel was quiet, certainly, and it had been a great relief to them that he hadn&#x2019;t filled the house up with loud young lads thumping one another. But they had thought this was part of his spiritual life, a preparation for a future as a priest. Now it appeared that this was certainly not the case.<br><br>Perhaps, Josie suggested, it was only the Brothers&#x2019; brand of religious life that Noel objected to. In fact, he might have a different kind of vocation and want to become a Jesuit or a missionary?<br><br>Apparently not.<br><br>And when he was fifteen he said that he didn&#x2019;t really want to join in the family Rosary anymore; it was only a ritual of meaningless prayers chanted in repetition. He didn&#x2019;t mind doing good for people, trying to make less fortunate people have a better life, but surely no God could want this fifteen minutes of drone drone drone.<br><br>By the time he was sixteen they realized that he didn&#x2019;t go to Sunday Mass anymore. Someone had seen him up by the canal when he was meant to have been to the early Mass up in the church on the corner. He told them that there was no point in his staying on at school, as there was nothing more he needed to learn from them. They were hiring office staff up at Hall&#x2019;s and they would train him in office routine. He might as well go to work straightaway rather than hang about.<br><br>The Brothers and the teachers at his school said it was always a pity to see a boy study and leave without a qualification, but still, they said, shrugging, it was very hard trying to interest the l...</p><h2>Dallas, an illustrated history</h2><p>Follows Dallas&#39; phenomenal growth from an ancient Indian settlement to the 7th largest city in the US.(1982)</p><p></p><h2>Mikhail Bakhtin: The Dialogical Principle (Theory &amp; History of Literature, Vol. 13) (English and French Edition)</h2><p>Briefly traces the life and career of Mikhail Bakhtin, a Russian critic, and discusses his writings about culture, texts, and meaning</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Sissinghurst: A Castle&#39;s Unfinished History: Restoring Vita Sackville-West&#39;s Celebrated Estate</h2><p>A fascinating account from award-winning author Adam Nicolson on the history of Nicolson's own national treasure, his family home: Sissinghurst.<br><br>Sissinghurst is world famous as a place of calm and beauty, a garden slipped into the ruins of a rose-pink Elizabethan palace. But is it entirely what its creators intended? Has its success over the last thirty years come at a price? Is Sissinghurst everything it could be? The story of this piece of land, an estate in the Weald of Kent, is told here for the first time from the very beginning. Adam Nicolson, who now lives there, has uncovered remarkable new findings about its history as a medieval manor and great sixteenth-century house, from the days of its decline as an eighteenth-century prison to a flourishing Victorian farm and on to the creation, by his grandparents Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson, of a garden in a weed-strewn wreck. Alongside his recovery of the past, Adam Nicolson wanted something else: for the land at Sissinghurst to live again, to become the landscape of orchards, cattle, fruit and sheep he remembered from his boyhood.Could that living frame of a mixed farm be brought back to what had turned into monochrome fields of chemicalised wheat and oilseed rape? Against the odds, he was going to try. Adam Nicolson has always been a passionate writer about landscape and buildings, but this is different. This is the place he wanted to make good again, reconnecting garden, farm and land. More than just a personal biography of a place, this book is the story of taking an inheritance and steering it in a new direction, just as an entrepreneur might take hold of a company, or just as all of us might want to take our dreams and make them real.</p><p>ADAM NICOLSON is the author of many books on history, travel, and the environment. He is the winner of the Somerset Maugham Award, the British Topography Prize, and the W.H. Heinemann Award. His previous books include <b>Sea Room</b>, <b>God's Secretaries</b>, <b>Seamanship</b>, <b>Men of Honour</b>, and <b>Earls of Paradise</b>.<b>CHAPTER <i>1</i><br>Sissinghurst<br></b>&nbsp;<br>I have lived at Sissinghurst, on<b> </b>and off, for the last forty-five years. For my entire conscious life it has been what I have thought of as home, even when living away, in London, or abroad. For all my attachment to other places, this has always seemed like the root. I belong to it. It is the land I have walked over, looked out over, driven through, smoked my first cigarette in, planted my first tree in, bicycled over, slept in, and lived in all my life. It is where I came to understand what a tree was, what a friend was, what a hideout was, what a landscape was, how entrancing streams were as they made their way in and out of the margins of a wood, and what solitariness, nature, and love might be.<br>&nbsp;<br>If I think of a view, or of mist on an autumn morning, the way it lies in a valley like a scarf, or the way a stream when blocked makes a reedy place upstream of the blockage, where after time willows grow in the wetness and make a dark summer tent over the bog; or the way wildflowers peak and then collapse as spring deepens into summer; if I think of geese belling across winter fields; or of being alone, or of the transition from childhood to adolescence, of the relationship of a place to its history or its future: every one of those things, strung out across my life, like lights marking a channel, is tied to and founded on Sissinghurst. It is the shape of what I am. I do not own it but it is my place. Anything else can only ever be an approximation to it.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is a tree in the garden, an oak, growing on the edge of the moat, that my sister Juliet and I planted together when she was four and I was one. It is nearly fifty years old but, in its tree life, still in its teens. One or two of the lower branches have been pruned, to improve its shape, and the bark of the oak is creeping back, in pillowed, almost animal ridges, across the scars that the saw has left. But the rest of the tree&#x2014;it is a strange hybrid, a sycamore oak, which has oak leaves but drops sycamore seeds in the autumn, the single wings helicoptering to the autumn grass&#x2014;the rest of the tree is in the first glowing moment of adulthood, no leaning in the trunk, a full head of hair, if you can say that about a tree, a kind of bushy-brushed wholeness to it, its trunk like the trunk of a young man. It is now part of the Sissinghurst landscape, rooted, solid, essential, inevitably there, and I feel in my heart as much part of this place as that tree. My nutrients come from this soil.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When I was a boy here in the 1960s, my father used to take us, my sisters and me, down to the stream that runs through the wood, usually after lunch in the winter, to have a boat race. We chose small, fat sticks for boats, to be thrown into the stream where it entered the wood below a marshy patch in the Dog Field. He cut long wands from the hazels for what he called &#x201c;hoikers&#x201d;&#x2014;the only way, if your stick got caught in the deep trench of the stream, that you could hoik it back into the main flow. No cheating was allowed, nor hurrying on of your stick if it happened to be drifting in a treacle-slow section of the current. It had to be stuck and immobile before you could push it back into the race with the hoiker. The finishing line was the chestnut bridge by the outflow from the lake. All of us cheated when he wasn&#x2019;t looking.<br>&nbsp;<br>Or there were clearance weekends and bonfires, the brambles and dead wood lopped and slashed away with billhooks and bowsaws, all piled onto a smoky fire, the smoke finding its way out through the roof of the coppiced chestnuts as if through the thatch of a medieval hall. He would send me down to the wood sometimes to start the fire on my own before he came to join me. Start it small, he said, but make it as big as you can. Once he raced me to Bettenham, the neighbor farm to Sissinghurst, half a mile away, him on foot, me on a bike. I remember him now, stampeding down the track ahead of me, uncatchable and distant, however hard I pedaled.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sissinghurst is embedded in the most explorable and boy-friendly of all landscapes, a part of Kent, no more than fifty miles south of London, called the Weald. That is an ancient Saxon or Germanic word meaning &#x201c;forest,&#x201d; but over the twelve or thirteen centuries since the Saxons arrived here, that huge stretch of woodland has been cut up and largely cleared so that the Weald now is a patchwork of small woods and farms, with streams curling between them and lanes connecting one to another. It is a stretch of country that is accessible to London and its commuters but has an enormously deep past and is still full of hidden secrets. A sense of invitation is plastered all over it, and on summer mornings, at breakfast, on the bleached and knotty deal of the kitchen table, my father would pore with me over a two-and-a-half-inch map of it, exploring its possibilities with our fingers: the gridlines pale blue, the occasional contours a browny orange, the stipple of the scattered farms, each with the blue spot of a farmyard pond. Why don&#x2019;t you go and see what the Hammer Brook is like here&#x2014;a bridge four miles away downstream&#x2014;or here, where it joins the Beult? You see where it says &#x201c;Roman Road&#x201d; there, where it goes down the contours of that hill? Or look, a Roman ford&#x2014;miles away, south of Benenden, into another parish&#x2014;why don&#x2019;t you see if you can go and find that?<br>&nbsp;<br>So I did, alone on my bike for hours and days at a time, looking for these places that he had made precious and important to me. I learned to read the map, which I kept folded in my pocket. I found the Roman road dropping south through woodland beyond Benenden: he must have known it but never told me he did, a place reverberating with the past, a huge trench as straight as it should be, just wobbling here and there like a piece of furniture two thousand years old, half a mile long, exactly preserved and deeply creased into the Wealden hill. I remember it now, its runnel filled with autumn leaves, the hornbeams and hazels on its banks, unvisited, unknown, the most wonderful and vivid antiquity I had ever seen. At the bottom of the valley, on a tiny tributary of the Rother no more than two feet wide, trickling to the south, with ferns and moss around them, I found the smooth dark stones of the Roman ford, scattered in the stream bed, as neglected as they had been since the Romans left fifteen hundred years before.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would return from these expeditions, excited and exhausted, unaware of the riches I was gathering. Only now do I see this as the best education a child could have: the private discovery of a stretch of country rich in buried meanings, so easily and fluently to hand, to be discovered with nothing more than a map and a bike. Seeing, I suppose, how much I loved it all, the finding of the way, the connections made in three dimensions that the map had hinted at and led one to, we started going on longer expeditions. One June morning, early, when the world was heavy with summer and greenness, we went for a long walk together through the flat, oak-hedged grasslands of the Low Weald toward Biddenden. I was about eleven and we walked from one fifteenth-century Wealden farmhouse to another, maybe twelve miles or so through the cold morning, the leaves gray with dew, the sun blinking through them, admiring the close-set studs, the pitch of the roofs designed for thatch, now tiled, the rooted richness of this country.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is not the buildings I remember, though, but a long hay meadow on the Hammer Brook, a mile or two upstream, just the other side of Hammer Mill, which we came to as we circled back to Sissinghurst and breakfast. I had never guessed that an air of perfection was not something to be dreamt about, but could be experienced on your skin, as a living, seen reality. I thought then and can still imagine now that the meadow was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. One side of the long narrow green space, perhaps four hundred yards from end to end, all of it walled in by the fresh green of the springtime wood, followed the brook&#x2019;s meandering path. The other took a long straight line against the trees. We were there the morning after the farmer, Mr. Hall, had mown the grass. He had begun by following the stream in his tractor and had laid his swathes in repeated, rippling slices that mimicked the stream itself, as if the wavy hair of the field had been combed flat but kept its wave, gleaming early that brilliant morning, like oiled braids, with the pale stubs of the shorn grass between each mown tress, the buttercups laid in with the grass as a summer wreath, a vision of perfection for that moment only, before Mr. Hall came back with his tractor later that morning and began to turn and stir the grass with his tedder into the lifted ridges in which he needed it to dry.<br>&nbsp;<br>We did other things: my father bought a double canoe and for three days we followed the Hammer Brook from where the Bettenham track crossed it, along its winding trench to the river Beult and then on to the Medway until we reached salt water at Rochester. We did the same on the Stour from Great Chart to Sandwich, taking with us this time, in a deliberate act of matchmaking, my cousin Robert Sackville-West, so that we would become friends, as we have remained for life. We walked to the North Downs across the Low Weald and then along the Pilgrim&#x2019;s Way. We went to see where William the Conqueror had landed and then Julius Caesar. It was as if my father was conquering Kent for me, not the Kent of commuter modernity but an older place, one in which nature and culture were more intimately bound together and of which Sissinghurst itself always seemed to be the center and the exemplar.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nowhere felt deeper or more like a vein under the skin than down in the bed of the Hammer Brook. It was an entrancing and different world, a green, wet womb, a place of privacy and escape.

There was no emergency room at the walk-in clinic at home, so she figured she had to be at least as far away as Kansas City. &#x201c;Good Lord,&#x201d; she thought. &#x201c;Of all the crazy things to have happen this morning.&#x201d; She had just wanted to pick a few figs and make a jar of fig preserves for that nice woman who had brought her a basket of tomatoes. And now here she was with some boy wearing a green shower cap and a green smock, looking down at her, all excited, talking a mile a minute to five other people running around the room, also in green shower caps, green smocks, and little green paper booties on their feet. Elner suddenly wondered why they weren&#x2019;t wearing white anymore. When had they changed that rule? The last time she had been to a hospital was thirty-four years ago, when her niece, Norma, had given birth to Linda; they had all worn white then. Her next-door neighbor Ruby Robinson, a bona fide professional registered nurse, still wore white, with white shoes and stockings and her snappy little cap with the wing tips. Elner thought white looked more professional and doctorlike than the wrinkly, baggy green things these people had on, and it wasn&#x2019;t even a pretty green to boot.<br><br> She had always loved a good neat uniform, but the last time her niece and her niece&#x2019;s husband had taken her to the picture show, she had been disappointed to see that the movie ushers no longer wore uniforms. In fact, they didn&#x2019;t even have ushers anymore; you had to find your own seat. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; thought Elner, &#x201c;they must have their reasons.&#x201d;<br><br> Then she suddenly began to wonder if she had turned off her oven before she had gone out in the yard to pick figs; or if she had fed her cat, Sonny, his breakfast yet. She also wondered what that boy in the ugly green shower cap and those other people leaning over, busy poking at her, were saying. She could see their lips moving all right, but she had not put her hearing aid on this morning, and all she could hear was a faint beeping noise, so she decided to try to take a little nap and wait for her niece Norma to come get her. She needed to get back home to check on Sonny and her stove, but she was not particularly looking forward to seeing her niece, because she knew she was going to get fussed at, but good. Norma was a highly nervous sort of a person and, after Elner&#x2019;s last fall, had told her time and time again, not to get up on that ladder and pick figs. Norma had made her promise to wait and let Macky, Norma&#x2019;s husband, come over and do it for her; and now not only had Elner broken a promise, this trip to the emergency room was sure to cost her a pretty penny.<br><br> A few years ago, when her neighbor Tot Whooten had gotten that needle-nosed hound fish stuck in her leg and wound up in the emergency room, Tot said they had charged her a small fortune. On reflection, Elner now realized that she probably should have called Norma; she had thought about calling, but she hadn&#x2019;t wanted to bother poor Macky for just a few figs. Besides, how could she know there was a wasps&#x2019; nest up in her tree? If it weren&#x2019;t for them, she would have been up and down that ladder with her figs, making fig preserves by now, and Norma would have been none the wiser. It was the wasps&#x2019; fault; they had no business being up there in the first place. But at this point she knew that all the excuses in the world would not hold much water with Norma. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in big trouble now,&#x201d; she thought, before she drifted off. &#x201c;I may have just lost ladder privileges for life.&#x201d;<br><br> 8:11 am<br><br> Earlier that morning Norma Warren, a still pretty brunette woman in her sixties, had been at home thumbing through her Linens for Less catalog, trying to decide whether or not to order the yellow tone-on- tone floral design chenille bedspread, or the cool seersucker 100-percent-cotton-with-plenty-of-pucker in sea foam green with ribbon stripes on a crisp white background, when her aunt&#x2019;s neighbor, and Norma&#x2019;s beautician, Tot Whooten, had called and informed her that her Aunt Elner had fallen off the ladder again. Norma had hung up the phone and immediately run to the kitchen sink and thrown cold water in her face to keep herself from fainting. She had a tendency to faint when she was upset. Then she quickly picked up the wall phone and dialed her husband Macky&#x2019;s cell phone number at work.<br><br> Macky, who was the manager of the hardware department at The Home Depot out at the mall, glanced at the readout of the number calling and answered.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, what&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Aunt Elner&#x2019;s fallen off the ladder again!&#x201d; said Norma frantically. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better get over there right now. God knows what she&#x2019;s broken. She could be lying over in her yard, dead for all I know. I told you we should have taken that ladder away from her!&#x201d;<br><br> Macky, who had been married to Norma for forty-three years and was used to her fits of hysteria, particularly where her Aunt Elner was concerned, said, &#x201c;All right, Norma, just calm down, I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;s fine. She hasn&#x2019;t killed herself yet, has she?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I told her not to get on that ladder again, but does she listen to me?&#x201d;<br><br> Macky started walking toward the door, past plumbing supplies, and spoke to a man on the way out. &#x201c;Hey, Jake, take over for me. I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d;<br><br> Norma continued talking a mile a minute in his ear. &#x201c;Macky, call me the minute you get there, and let me know, but if she&#x2019;s dead, don&#x2019;t even tell me, I can&#x2019;t handle a tragedy right now. . . . Oh I could just kill her. I knew something like this was going to happen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Norma, just hang up and try to relax, go sit in the living room, and I&#x2019;ll call you in a few minutes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This is it, I am taking that ladder away from her as of today. The very idea of an old woman like her . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hang up, Norma.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She could have broken every bone in her body.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you,&#x201d; he said, and hung up.<br><br> Macky walked out to the back parking lot, got in his Ford SUV and headed over to Elner&#x2019;s house. He had learned the hard way; whenever there was a problem with Aunt Elner, having Norma there only made matters worse, so he made Norma stay at home until he could get to Elner&#x2019;s and size up the situation.<br><br> After Macky hung up, Norma ran into the living room like he had said to do, but she certainly could not calm down or even sit down until he called to tell her everything was all right. I swear to God, she thought, if she hasn&#x2019;t killed herself this time, not only am I taking that ladder away from</p><h2>The Tree of Life: A Phylogenetic Classification (Harvard University Press Reference Library)</h2><p><p>Did you know that you are more closely related to a mushroom than to a daisy?

Certain facts, however, are beyond dispute. </p><p> It happened on a late fall afternoon in 1863, when a knife-wielding drunkard -- described in existing accounts as "deranged" -- attacked the bartender at Stratton's Hotel on Bloomingdale Road and 125th Street in Manhattan. Shouts of "Murder!" and frantic cries for help erupted from the barroom. Struck, a member of the Metropolitan Police force working in Manhattanville, appeared a few minutes later. By the time he showed up, however, the assailant was already dead -- shot down by a detective who, by happenstance, had been riding past the hotel when he'd heard the commotion. </p><p> That much is certain. The great, unresolved question is: Why didn't Officer Struck get there sooner? </p><p> Several hotel employees testified that Struck had, in fact, been right outside the hotel when the fracas broke out, but refused to intervene. The enraged drunk, he believed, was brandishing a pistol, while Struck -- like all New York City policemen at the time -- was armed with nothing but a billy club. Turning on his heels, he had dashed off in the opposite direction -- ostensibly to get help. </p><p> When Struck's superiors at the Manhattanville station learned of these accusations of cowardice, they took immediate action. Without so much as a hearing, Officer Struck was summarily discharged from the force. </p><p> Struck's account of these events was considerably different. According to the story he told his wife, Lydia, he was blocks away from the hotel, walking his beat, when he heard that someone had just gone berserk in the Stratton barroom. He'd immediately hopped on a streetcar and hurried to the scene, only to find that the disturbance was already over. </p><p> He had been dismissed, he insisted, not because he was a coward but, on the contrary, because he was a man of principle. The Manhattanville precinct was rife with corruption, and Struck -- so he claimed -- was simply too honest for his own good. He knew things that made his superiors extremely nervous. His supposedly craven conduct in the Stratton barroom affair had been nothing more than a convenient pretext for getting rid of him. </p><p> Lydia chose to believe her husband's version. She was, after all, an utterly devoted wife and mother. At least, that was how she thought of herself. This wildly deluded self-image, in fact, was a mark of her utter derangement. For Lydia Struck belonged to that terrifying species of sociopaths who commit the most hideous atrocities imaginable, while telling themselves that they are only acting for the good of their victims. </p><p> Whatever the truth behind Struck's dismissal, it was a devastating blow to the man. He had worked hard all his adult life to earn an honest wage, sustained in his struggles by his deep religious faith. Both he and his wife were devout Christians. They had first gotten to know each other, in fact, while attending the same Methodist church in New Brunswick, New Jersey, twenty years earlier. </p><p> Struck was nearly forty at the time, a widower with six young children. Lydia, a tailoress by trade, was only seventeen: a fetching young woman with rich chestnut hair, large blue eyes, and a milky complexion. Despite the disparity in their ages, she readily accepted when Struck proposed marriage to her not long after they met. The ceremony took place at the home of her brother, Ellsworth. Within a year of the nuptials, Lydia had given birth to a healthy girl. Six more babies followed in rapid succession. </p><p> With a wife and thirteen children to support -- seven by Lydia, six from his earlier marriage -- Struck, a carriage blacksmith, toiled away at his trade, first in Yorkville, then on Elizabeth Street in lower Manhattan, just north of the infamous Five Points slum district. Eventually, he moved his family uptown, where they rented the first floor of a small house on 125th Street. It was then that a golden opportunity presented itself. </p><p> After years of political wrangling, the city of New York was in the process of reorganizing its police force. In January 1857, Struck applied for and obtained an appointment to the newly created Metroplitan Police. For six years, he patrolled the streets of the Manhattanville ward, proud to wear the uniform: blue frock coat, dark vest, blue pantaloons, star-shaped copper badge. He was, he believed, a credit to the force. </p><p> Then came the Stratton barroom fiasco, and Struck found himself not only unemployed but branded a coward. </p><p> By this time, there had been a significant reduction in the size of the Struck household. All six of Edward's children by his first marriage had grown up and left home. And little Josephine -- the daughter Lydia had given birth to less than two years before -- had died after a painful bout of intestinal illness. In light of later events, it is reasonable to speculate that the little girl did not perish of natural causes. The doctor who attended her, however, had no cause to suspect foul play and attributed her death to "inflammation of the bowels." </p><p> Even with seven fewer mouths to feed, the Strucks still had six sons and daughters to care for. With the whole family crowded into a few dreary rooms and not a penny coming in to feed them, Edward plunged into a state of extreme despondency that had all the earmarks of what we now call clinical depression. He wouldn't look for work or see his old friends. After a while, he wouldn't leave the house at all. He was ashamed to show himself in public, convinced that he was an object of universal contempt. His behavior grew increasingly erratic. He would lie awake at night, certain that he was about to be arrested. On one occasion, he took a pistol from a bureau drawer, stuck it in his mouth, and threatened to blow his head off. Eventually, he stopped getting out of bed. </p><p> Lydia suffered terribly to see her husband sink into such a hopeless condition. With every passing day, he was becoming an increasingly onerous burden. "He caused me at this time a great deal of trouble" was the way Lydia later put it. She sought advice from Captain Hart, her husband's immediate superior at the Manhattanville station. Hart -- a decent fellow who had tried in vain to get Struck reinstated -- shook his head at Lydia's shocking account of her husband's behavior. The man was clearly out of his mind. As far as Hart could see, there was only one thing to be done. Her husband must be "put out of the way," Hart gently told her -- advice that was seconded by several other people she consulted. </p><p> Exactly what was intended by this suggestion is somewhat unclear, though Hart apparently meant that Struck should be committed to an insane asylum before he did harm to himself or his loved ones. Lydia, however, chose to place a different construction on the words. </p><p> Scraping together ten cents from her meager household funds, she repaired to a drugstore in Harlem and purchased an ounce of powdered arsenic. </p><p> The druggist who dispensed the poison would not have raised an eyebrow at Lydia's request. Arsenic was a popular over-the-counter item at the time, sold in various forms and used -- bizarrely enough -- as both a pesticide and a beauty product. A homeowner whose premises were infested with rodents might deal with the problem by sprinkling his floorboards with an arsenic compound called "Rough on Rats." At the same time, his adolescent daughter might hope to improve her complexion by dosing herself with "Bellavita Arsenic Beauty Tablets" -- absolutely guaranteed (according to the newspaper ads) to eliminate "Pimples, Blotches, Freckles, Sunburn, Discolorations, Eczema, Blackheads, Roughness, Redness, and to Restore the Bloom of Youth to Faded Faces!" </p><p> That American women would eagerly ingest rat poison for its supposedly cosmetic properties seems flatly incredible to us -- equivalent to treating a bad case of acne by swallowing a few shots of Raid. But it was typical of those wildly unregulated, pre-FDA days, when the marketplace was flooded with medicinal cure-alls concocted of everything from cocaine and chloroform to morphine and mercury. </p><p> And so the druggist would have sold Lydia all the poison she wanted, no questions asked. Lydia requested an ounce, but she probably came away with even more, since arsenic was so cheap that most druggists rarely measured it out with any precision, scooping a mound of it onto a paper, then either transferring it into a bottle or wrapping it up into a neat little package. </p><p> Two to four grains of white arsenic -- a fraction of a teaspoonful -- is enough to kill an adult human being. For ten pennies, Lydia Struck -- one of the most remorseless sociopaths ever produced in this country -- purchased enough of the poison to murder every member of her household several times over. </p><p> By this time, the fifty-nine-year-old Struck had ceased performing the most basic functions. He no longer seemed capable of washing, dressing, or feeding himself. Back at home, Lydia fixed her husband a nice bowl of oatmeal gruel, then -- using one of her sewing thimbles as a measure -- sprinkled in a small but deadly portion of the powdered arsenic and stirred it into the porridge. Seated at his bedside, she helped him drink the noxious mixture down. As the afternoon wore on, she fed him several additional servings. There is no evidence to suggest that, as she killed her husband of eighteen years, Lydia experienced anything other than a sense of the fullest satisfaction. It was, she felt, the merciful thing to do. After all -- as she later put it -- it was clear that he "would never be any good to me or to himself again." </p><p> There is a quaint, <i>Arsenic and Old Lace</i> quality that we tend to associate with the crimes committed by female poisoners, as though disposing of a few people by feeding them arsenic-laced oatmeal or hot chocolate were a rather genteel form of murder. The truth is that, compared to the agonies suffered by the average poisoning victim, the deaths meted out by male serial killers like Jack the Ripper, "Son of Sam," or the Boston Strangler -- the sudden executions by knife blade, bullet, or garrote -- seem positively humane. </p><p> In most cases of arsenic ingestion, the commencement of symptoms occurs within the hour. The first sign is an acrid sensation in the throat. Nausea sets in, growing more unbearable by the moment. Then the vomiting begins. It continues long after the stomach is empty, until the victim is heaving up a foul whitish fluid streaked with blood. The mouth is parched, the tongue thickly coated, the throat constricted. The victim is seized with a terrible thirst. Anything he drinks, however -- even a few sips of ice water -- only makes the vomiting worse. </p><p> Uncontrollable diarrhea -- often bloody, and invariably accompanied by racking abdominal pain -- follows the vomiting. Some victims experience a violent burning from mouth to anus. Urine is scanty and red in color. As the hours pass, the victim's face -- deathly pale to begin with -- takes on a bluish tint. The eyes grow hollow. The skin is slick with perspiration that gives off an unusually thick, fetid odor. The victim's breathing becomes harsh and irregular, his extremities cold, his heartbeat feeble. There may be convulsions of the limbs and excruciating cramps in the muscles of the legs. Depending on the amount of poison consumed, this torment may last anywhere from five or six hours to several days. </p><p> In Struck's case, it lasted until early the next morning. Lydia sat up with him throughout the night, while her husband underwent his harrowing disintegration before her vaguely curious eyes. </p><p> His death, when it finally came at around eight o'clock on the morning of May 24, 1864 was -- just as Lydia had intended -- a mercy. </p><p> The attending physician, Dr. N. Hustead, decided that Edward Struck had perished of natural causes. On the official certificate, he filled in the cause of death as "consumption." </p><p> Lydia Struck was now a forty-two-year-old widow with no means of support and six children to care for. She would not, however, remain in those circumstances for very long. Within a few years of Struck's death, she would no longer be a widow. </p><p> Or a mother. </p><p> In our own time, the case of Susan Smith -- "The Modern Medea," as the media dubbed her -- transfixed our country with horror. In October 1994, the twenty-three-year-old mother drove her Mazda Protegé to the shore of John D. Long Lake in Union, South Carolina, and sent the car rolling down a boat ramp with her two little boys, ages one and three, strapped into the backseat. Smith watched for more than five minutes as the car bobbed on the surface, then slowly filled with water, then sank with her babies inside. So unthinkable was the crime that -- in the perversely paradoxical way of such atrocities -- it became a national obsession, impossible to stop thinking about. How could a mother do such a thing -- set the deaths of her own babies in motion, then stand idly by while their helpless lives were extinguished before her eyes? </p><p> One hundred and thirty years before Susan Smith committed the filicide that made her (in the judgment of the tabloids) "America's Most Hated Woman," Lydia Struck perpetrated a similar horror. She did not, however, murder her own two children. </p><p> She murdered all six. </p><p> By the end of June, just a month after disposing of her husband, Lydia was feeling "much discouraged and downhearted" by the difficulty of supporting the children on her own. The three youngest -- six-year-old Martha Ann, four-year-old Edward Jr., and baby William, aged nine months and fifteen days -- were a particular burden, since they "could [do] nothing for me or for themselves." Of course, she did not want to act rashly. She therefore "thought the matter over for several days" before coming to the inevitable conclusion "that it would be better for them if they were out of the way." </p><p> In the first week of July, she poisoned all three of them with arsenic. Their deaths are described in the confession that Lydia ultimately supplied to the authorities. It is a remarkable document, offering hair-raising insight into the workings of a profoundly diseased mind. In it, Lydia reveals herself to be a quintessential psychopath, an utterly self-gratifying monster who contemplates and carries out the most unimaginable horrors without displaying the slightest trace of normal human emotion. </p><p> Martha Ann was the first to go. "She was taken with vomiting soon after I gave her the arsenic," Lydia writes, "and was afflicted in that way until she died. The doctors said nothing to indicate that they knew what was the matter." </p><p> Edward went later that same day.

After the bloodshed at Lexington and Concord, England&#x2019;s King George sent hundreds of ships westward to bottle up American harbors and prey on American shipping. Colonists had no force to defend their coastline and waterways until John Adams of Massachusetts proposed a bold solution: The Continental Congress should raise a navy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The idea was mad. The Royal Navy was the mightiest floating arsenal in history, with a seemingly endless supply of vessels. More than a hundred of these were massive &#x201c;ships of the line,&#x201d; bristling with up to a hundred high-powered cannon that could level a city. The British were confident that His Majesty&#x2019;s warships would quickly bring the rebellious colonials to their knees.<br> &nbsp;<br> They were wrong. Beginning with five converted merchantmen, America&#x2019;s sailors became formidable warriors, matching their wits, skills, and courage against the best of the British fleet. Victories off American shores gave the patriots hope&#x2014;victories led by captains such as John Barry, the fiery Irish-born giant; fearless Nicholas Biddle, who stared down an armed mutineer; and James Nicholson, the underachiever who finally redeemed himself with an inspiring display of coolness and bravery. Meanwhile, along the British coastline, daring raids by handsome, cocksure John Paul Jones and the &#x201c;Dunkirk Pirate,&#x201d; Gustavus Conyngham&#x2014;who was captured and sentenced to hang but tunneled under his cell and escaped to fight again&#x2014;sent fear throughout England. The adventures of these men and others on both sides of the struggle rival anything from Horatio Hornblower or Lucky Jack Aubrey. In the end, these rebel sailors, from the quarterdeck to the forecastle, contributed greatly to American independence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meticulously researched and masterfully told, <i>Give Me a Fast Ship</i> is a rousing, epic tale of war on the high seas&#x2014;and the definitive history of the American Navy during the Revolutionary War.<br><br> <b>INCLUDES NINE MAPS AND SIXTEEN PAGES OF FULL COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS</b></p><p><b>Tim McGrath</b> is the author of the critically acclaimed biography <i>John Barry: An American Hero in the Age of Sail</i>.

Critics and young readers rejoiced at her three previous novels--<i>Squashed</i>, <i>Thwonk</i>, and <i>Sticks</i>--and with <i>Rules of the Road</i>, she has written a story that is wise and touching as well as comical. Jenna Boller is too tall for a sophomore and she's not much good in school. Her sister Faith got all the looks in the family, but boy, can Jenna sell shoes! She's supremely happy at her after-school job at Gladstone's, where the big white sign over the door says "We're Not Just Selling Shoes, We're Selling Quality." When elderly Mrs. Madeline Gladstone, the crusty president of the company, chooses Jenna as her driver on a business trip to visit other Gladstone's stores, Jenna goes reluctantly--with trepidation at driving the huge Cadillac, and at the prospect of leaving her alcoholic father behind. But on the road, Jenna learns "great road truths" such as "Never eat at a place called Mom's, because it's a safe bet Mom's been dead for years." She also proves to be indispensable (possessing an eagle eye for shoddy quality and sloppy service), and soon learns to admire and love the irascible Mrs. Gladstone as well as her old friend, "World's Best Shoe Salesman" Harry Bender. When Harry dies suddenly, Jenna realizes that she wishes he had been her father. Trouble looms in the form of a company takeover by Mrs. Gladstone's sleazy son, Elden, "Shoe Rodent," but Jenna summons courage from Harry's memory and saves the day for quality shoes. <i>Rules of the Road</i> is a treat that will utterly delight readers. (Age 12 and older) <i>--Patty Campbell</i>Jenna Boller is the best employee at her branch of Gladstone&#39;s Shoes -- she can sell anybody anything. But her family problems are harder to handle, and there are times when Jenna wishes she could just get out of town and take a break. So when Madeline Gladstone, the elderly president of Gladstone Shoe Stores, hires Jenna as her driver for the summer, Jenna leaps at the chance -- right into the driver&#39;s seat. And that begins a cross-country adventure from Chicago to Dallas, where she and Mrs. Gladstone learn a lot about the rules of the road . . . and the rules of life.</p><h2>Leonardo da Vinci: Meet the Artist!

When one of them is murdered, Inspector Roderick Alleyn's investigation takes him through petty vendettas, an ex-commander's blend of whiskey and archery, and cocktails on the lawn with a femme fatale. But the motive he's angling for lies even deeper than the trout stream beneath the rustic bridge...<br></p><p>From her first book in 1934 to her final volume just before her death in 1982, <b>Ngaio Mars</b>h's work has remained legendary, and is often compared to that of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. During her celebrated fifty-year career, Marsh was made a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, was named Dame Commander, Order of the British Empire, won numerous prestigious awards, and penned 32 mystery novels.<br><br>Now St. Martin's Dead Letter Mysteries is thrilled to make all of Marsh's novels available again for old fans to relish and new ones to discover. So sit back, draw the curtains, lock the doors, and put yourself in the hands of Grande Dame of detective novels...<br>Listening to SCALES OF JUSTICE is like taking a trip back to mid-twentieth-century rural England. The classes know their place, eccentricities abound, the district nurse is named Kettle, and the story has a featured cat. No accent, implication, or physical description escapes narrator Peter Wickham&#39;s sparkling presentation. When one of the local villagers is murdered, everyone is suspect. The indomitable Roderic Alleyn and his sidekick, Fox, wade through clues and fish scales (note the title) to find the culprit. The best part is an endearing romance that&#39;s totally unexpected. The vintage style of story and presentation make this a perfect audiobook. Like the works of Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, Marsh&#39;s classic mysteries will live forever.

The Bureau of Prisons gave Earley (Family of Spies, 1988) unprecedented permission to come and go as he pleased and talk to any inmate without guards present. Earley's end of the deal: he would have no protection. His chronicle concentrates on five prisoners, the new warden, and several guards. Meet Carl Cletus Bowles, three life sentences: paroled in 1965, he robbed a bank, kidnapped the California state controller general, his wife, and their small child, stole several cars, held six other people hostage, and murdered an Oregon policeman. What goes on in the mind of a man like that? Earley spent two years talking to him. Meet Lieutenant Phillip Shoats, head guard of 719 Marielistas. He was a tough guy who could make the Cubans walk a chalk line while reports of his brutality were suppressed. Then he was blown away by a shotgun wielded by his 14-year-old son, desperate after the beatings Shoats was giving him, his brother, and mother. Did Leavenworth brutalize Shoats or was it the terrible secret he wouldn't tell his wife, revealed only at his death? In the pen there are only two emotions: fear and rage. Here is where a man ``runs the gears'' on the man in the next cell for playing his radio too loud (``You slam a shank into his chest and then pull up and over and then down and over, just like shifting gears on a car''). Here is the stronghold of the predatory gang--the Aryan Brotherhood--that specializes in protection, extortion, and narcotics. To join, one must ``earn his bones'' by murdering someone. Earley, amazingly, gained the confidence of one of the gang's founders, who told him: ``At San Quentin, the herds [blacks] were getting out of hand and a bunch of old white bulls simply said `Fuck this' and they decided to stand up....''

So write Michael Hammer and James Champy in this pioneering book on the most important topic in business circles today: reengineering - the radical redesign of a company's processes, organization, and culture. Reengineering the Corporation offers nothing less than a brand-new vision of how companies should be organized and managed if they are to succeed - indeed even survive - in the 1990s and beyond. Reengineering does not seek to make businesses better through incremental improvements - 10 percent faster here or 20 percent less expensive there. The aim of reengineering is a quantum leap in performance - the 100 percent or even tenfold improvements that can follow from entirely new work processes and structures.<br>Building on their firsthand experiences, Hammer and Champy show how some of the world's premier corporations use the principles of reengineering to save hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to achieve unprecedented levels of customer satisfaction, and to speed up and make more flexible all aspects of their operations. The key to reengineering is abandoning the most basic notions on which the modern organization is founded. Today's workers and managers are prisoners of antiquated theories about organizing work - theories that date back to the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. These ideas - the division of labor, the need for elaborate controls, the managerial hierarchy - no longer work in a world of global competition and unrelenting change. In their stead, the authors introduce the notion of process orientation, of concentrating on and rethinking end-to-end activities that create value for customers.<br>This book is about more than ideas, however. From their work with leading companies around the world, Hammer and Champy have learned how to make reengineering succeed. They lay out the approaches that have enabled such companies as Bell Atlantic, Taco Bell, and Hallmark Cards to reinvent themselves. They offer a vision of the reengineered corporation and a road map for companies to follow in getting there.</p><p><i>Reengineering the Corporation</i> sets aside much of the received wisdom of the last 200 years of industrial management and in its place presents a new set of organizing principles by which managers can rebuild their businesses. <p> The book provides numerous examples and in-depth case studies of how leading organizations are achieving significant competitive gains through reengineering: How Ford Motor reduced the size of its North American accounts payable organization by 80% while improving the process; how IBM is leasing subsidiary cut its deal-making process from seven days to four hours; and how Taco Bell used a new set of production and management processes to fuel a six-fold growth in revenue.</p>Michael Hammer is the originator and leading exponent of the concept of reengineering and was named one of the four preeminent management gurus of the 1990s by Business Week. James Champy is chairman of Perot Systems consulting practice and is the leading authority on the implementation of business reengineering initiatives.</p><h2>Antarctica</h2><p>There have been many books about Antarctica in the past, but all have focused on only one aspect of the continent - its science, its wildlife, the heroic age of exploration, personal experiences or the sheer awesome beauty of the landscape- but none have managed to capture the whole story, until now. Gabrielle Walker, author, consultant to New Scientist and regular broadcaster with the BBC has written a book unlike any that has ever been written about the continent. Antarctica weaves all the significant threads into an intricate tapestry, made up of science, natural history, poetry, epic history, what it feels like to be there and why it draws so many different kinds of people back there again and again. It is only when all the parts come together that the underlying truths of the continent emerge. Antarctica is the most alien place on Earth, the only part of our planet where humans could never survive unaided. It is truly like walking on another planet. And yet, in its silence, its agelessness and its mysteries lie the secrets of our past, and of our future.</p><p>Gabrielle Walker has a PhD in natural sciences from Cambridge University and has taught at both Cambridge and Princeton universities. She is Chief Scientist of strategic advisory firm Xynteo, a consultant to New Scientist, contributes frequently to BBC radio and writes for many newspapers and magazines.

Many people will approach this book with images from David Attenborough&#39;s Frozen Planet stamped on their minds. Can it add to the live footage we&#39;ve seen? Emphatically yes. * Guardian * This is not just a highly accessible ency-clopedia of Antarctic science. It interlaces researchers&#39; stories with natural history, tales of the &#39;heroic age&#39; of exploration and pas-sages that viscerally describe the cold, isola-tion and beauty of the environment. * Nature * The early Antarctic expeditions are thoroughly covered in this enthralling book. But, then again, so is every other aspect of a place that continues to haunt the human imagination ... Perhaps best of all, Walker gives us a fantastically vivid sense of what it&#39;s like to be in Antarctica. * Reader&#39;s Digest *</p><h2>The Second Treatise of Civil Government</h2><p><p> In this, the second of his <em>Two Treatises of Government</em>, John Locke examines humankind&#x2019;s transition from its original state of nature to a civil society. One can see the lasting influence of Locke&#x2019;s ideas through their familiarity to the modern reader&#x2015;the roots of classical liberalism are here, and many of Locke&#x2019;s arguments foreshadow contemporary debates concerning government, liberty, and property rights. The introduction and annotations included in this edition are intended to contextualize the work and prevent misunderstanding, without advancing any particular scholarly interpretation or merely summarizing Locke&#x2019;s reasoning.

This edition includes: The Days of the Turbins, Zoya&#39;s Apartment, Flight, The Crimson Island and A Cabal of Hypocrites (Moliere).</p><p>Mikhail Afanasievich Bulgakov was born in Kiev in 1891, the son of a professor of theology. Medicine, religion, and education were the dominant careers in his family. Politically, the family appears to have belonged to the liberal monarchist camp. Despite an early interest in literature and the theater, Bulgakov chose to become a doctor. In 1914, as a medical student, he volunteered with the Red Cross during World War I. After graduating from the University of Kiev in 1916, he served in the White Army during the Civil War, and was subsequently drafted by the Ukrainian Nationalist Army. These experiences during the chaos of the Civil War in Kiev and the Caucasus would have a profound effect on the writer and his work. His two younger brothers disappeared during the fighting around Kiev, and later surfaced in Europe. In 1919, while in the Caucasus, he made the decision to leave medicine for literature; soon after he almost emigrated, but was prevented from doing so by illness. By 1921 he was in Moscow where his literary career began in earnest. <i>The Diaboliad</i> collection, published in 1925, was his major publication of this time, since his masterpiece, <i>Heart of a Dog</i>, could not get past the censorship. This same period saw the partial publication of his novel about Kiev during the Civil War, <i>White Guard</i>. Publication ceased when the journal serializing the novel was shut down; however, enough had come out to arouse the interest of the Moscow Art Theater, which commissioned a play based on <i>White Guard</i>. This play, <i>Days of the Turbins</i>, was the source of Bulgakov's fame for the rest of his life, and was a major sensation both due to its vivid characterizations and its portrayal of a monarchist family in a sympathetic light rather than as monsters, which was the norm at this time. By the late twenties, when he had a number of other plays in production (<i>Zoya's Apartment, Flight</i> and <i>The Crimson Island</i>), Bulgakov had drawn down the wrath of the critics who felt that everything he wrote was essentially anti-Soviet. This was a period of extreme polarization, and Bulgakov's career was destroyed by 1929. He would have one more original play, <i>Moliere</i>, staged in his lifetime (but it was quickly withdrawn from production due to the critics), but all publication of his prose ceased after 1927. In 1930 he wrote his famous letter to Stalin, defending his right to be a satirist, and asking that his country let him emigrate if it could not find any use for his talents. Stalin, who had actually seen <i>Days of the Turbins</i> many times, answered this letter with a phone call, and soon afterward Bulgakov had employment with a small theater. The Moscow Art Theater then found work for him, but most of the projects he worked on came to nothing, and the last eight years of his life were full of stress and disappointment. He broke with Stanislavsky and the Art Theater after the <i>Moliere</i> debacle, and began to write <i>Theatrical Novel</i> as a way of venting his spleen. From 1928 on, Bulgakov had worked only sporadically on his major work, <i>The Master and Margarita</i>; in 1937 he dropped <i>Theatrical Novel</i>, which would remain unfinished, and concentrated on the novel about the devil in Moscow. When he died of sclerosis of the kidneys (which had killed his father at the same age) in 1940, he had finished <i>The Master and Margarita,</i> but had not completed final editing corrections. This novel, which would be considered one of the best Russian novels of the twentieth century, was not published until 1966-67 (and then in censored form), twenty-six years after Bulgakov's death. <i>Heart of a Dog</i>, however, was not published until 1987, the height of glasnost under Gorbachev--more than sixty years after it was written--a true indication of just how threatening satire could be to a totalitarian regime.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>The Missing (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p>A masterful novel set in 1920s Louisiana, <i>The Missing </i>is the story of Sam Simoneaux, a floorwalker at a New Orleans department store. When a little girl is kidnapped on Sam&#x2019;s watch he is haunted by guilt, grief, and ghosts from his own troubled past. Determined to find her, Sam sets out on a journey through a world of music and violence, where riverboats teem with drinking and dancing, and where dark swamplands conceal those who choose to live by their own laws. With the fate of the stolen child looming, <i>The Missing </i>vividly depicts an America lurching away from war, where civilization is only beginning to penetrate the hinterlands, and a man must choose between compassion and vengeance.</p><p><b>Tim Gautreaux</b> is the author of two previous novels and two collections of stories. His work has appeared in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>, as well as in volumes of the O. Henry and The Best American Short Story annuals. A professor emeritus in English at Southeastern Louisiana University, he lives with his family in Hammond.Chapter One<br><br>Sam Simoneaux leaned against the ship&#x2019;s rail, holding on in the snarling wind as his lieutenant struggled toward him<br>through the spray, grabbing latches, guy wires, valve handles. &#x201c;Pretty bad belowdecks,&#x201d; the lieutenant cried out against the<br>blow.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a fact. Stinks too bad to eat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I noticed you have a bit of an accent. Where are you from?&#x201d;<br><br>Sam felt sorry for him. The lieutenant was trying to be popular with his men, but none of them could imagine such a white- blond beanpole from a farm in Indiana leading anyone into battle. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I have an accent. But you do.&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant gave him a startled look. &#x201c;Me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Where I was raised in south Louisiana, nobody talks like you.&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant smiled. &#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s got an accent, then.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam looked at the spray running over the man&#x2019;s pale freckles, thinking that in a heavy frost he&#x2019;d be nearly invisible. &#x201c;You come up on a farm?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, sure. My family moved down from Canada about twenty years ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was raised on a farm but figured I could do better,&#x201d; Sam yelled. &#x201c;The lady down the road from us had a piano and she taught it to me. Moved to New Orleans when I was sixteen to be close to the music.&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant bent into the next blast of wind. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with you there. I can&#x2019;t throw bales far enough to farm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How many days till we get to France?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The colonel says three more, the captain, two, the pilot, four.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam nodded. &#x201c;Nobody knows what&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on, like usual.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s a big war,&#x201d; the lieutenant said. They watched a huge swell climb the side of the rusty ship and engulf a machine- gun crew hunkered down below them in a makeshift nest of sandbags, the deluge flushing men out on deck, where they slid on their bellies in the foam.<br><br>The next few days were a lurching penance of bad ocean, flinttopped rollers breaking against the bows and spray blowing by the portholes like broken glass. Inside the ship, Sam slept among the thousands of complaining, groaning, and heaving men, but spent his waking hours at the rails, sometimes with his friend Melvin Robicheaux, a tough little fellow from outside of Baton Rouge. On November 11, 1918, their steamer escaped the mountainous Atlantic and landed at Saint-Nazaire, where the wharves were jammed with people cheering, some dancing together, others running in wild rings.<br><br>Robicheaux pointed down over the rusty side of the ship. &#x201c;How come everybody&#x2019;s dancin&#x2019;? They all got a bottle of wine. You think they glad to see us?&#x201d;<br><br>Tugboats and dock locomotives were blowing their whistles through a hanging gauze of coal smoke. As he watched the celebration, Sam felt happy that he&#x2019;d shown up with his rifle. The French looked like desperate people ecstatic about an approaching rescue. However, as the tugboats whistled and pushed the ship against the dock, he sensed the festival wasn&#x2019;t for this boatload of soldiers but for some more important event. Hardly anybody was waving at the ship.<br><br>Four thousand troops unloaded onto the dock, and when all the men were lined up under the freight sheds and out of the wind, a colonel climbed onto a pile of ammunition crates and announced through a megaphone that an armistice had just been signed and the war was over.<br><br>Many cheered, but a portion of the young recruits seemed disappointed that they wouldn&#x2019;t get to shoot at anybody. The weapons hanging on them, the ammunition stacked around in wooden crates, the cannons still being unloaded by the puffing dock cranes were suddenly redundant. Sam wondered what he would tell his friends back home of his war experience. The most valuable trophies of war were the stories, and this one was good only for a derisive laugh.<br><br>Robicheaux poked him in the back with the tip of his bayonet scabbard. &#x201c;This like that time you tried workin&#x2019; at Stein&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stein, the shoe man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. I guess so.&#x201d; He had tried for two weeks to get a job at Stein&#x2019;s Shoe Emporium on Canal Street, but the morning after the old man had finally decided to take him on, Sam showed up for work only to find a wreath on the door and a typed note announcing the death of Solomon Stein and the permanent closure of his shop.<br><br>He stood in his ranks for an hour feeling awkward and unnecessary while the officers tried to figure what to do with all these soldiers and their tons of gear. Sam&#x2019;s long suit was patience, or at least an ability to wait for something good to happen, so he stood there, watching the civilians cheer as the men around him grumbled that they might have to file onto the ship for a lurching voyage back to New Orleans. It was cold, and he was hungry. After a long while, boys pushing carts of food came up and fed each man a miniature loaf of hard bread with a slice of cheese hanging out like a pale tongue. Then they were marched five miles to the edge of the city, where they pitched camp in a bald field that, judging by the stumps and posturing bronze statues, must once have been a landscaped park. An icy breeze flowed down a boulevard feeding into the camp, and Sam fastened the top button on his tunic and closed his coat. He had never felt a wind that cold in his life.<br><br>That night he was sure he would freeze to death. Robicheaux, his tent mate, lay on his cot talking nonstop.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Simoneaux, I&#x2019;m thinkin&#x2019; of a warm fire, me. Hot potatoes in each pocket. How about you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinkin&#x2019; about those recruiting posters. They made joining up look like a good idea,&#x201d; he said glumly.<br><br>&#x201c;I liked the one with the Hun molesting them Belgian women.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam raised his head from his cot and looked at him. &#x201c;You liked it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean it made me mad. Made me want to come over and help &#x2019;em out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You wanted to make them Belgian women grateful, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You bet.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam covered his head. &#x201c;Sometimes I think about the music. I was sales clerk at Gruenwald&#x2019;s when I joined up, and we got in all this sheet music full of sunshine, like &#x2018;Over There,&#x2019; &#x2018;Somewhere in France Is Daddy,&#x2019; &#x2018;Keep Your Head Down, Fritzie Boy.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Robicheaux sniffed. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;d need to keep your head down between your legs to keep your ears from freezin&#x2019; off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So far,&#x201d; Sam said dreamily, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s not a happy song.&#x201d; At home, the war had seemed a colorful musical production, a gay fox- trot in the key of C, but the voyage on the <i>Alex Denkman </i>changed all that. The <i>Denkman </i>was a round- bottom, coal- burning nausea machine, its hull so fouled with giant streamers of rust that the government decided painting a camouflage pattern on it was unnecessary. A boy who&#x2019;d grown up in Sam&#x2019;s hometown had died en route of a burst appendix and was buried at sea after a perfunctory prayer. Sam and several other Louisiana men had stood in snow flurries on the fantail and watched the shrouded figure bob in the ship&#x2019;s rolling wake, refusing to sink, as though the corpse itself didn&#x2019;t feel right about the lead- cold sea and was trying to drift back toward the warm soil of a Louisiana graveyard. He was a Duplechen boy, his father a wiry little farmer who was good with mules. Sam knew the man and could imagine his sorrow, the vacant place at his table, the forever- broken link. This cold camp seemed a minor inconvenience next to that, and he turned over and went to sleep.<br><br>One morning, after a week of camping among the statues, he watched a group of officers drive up in an open motorcar and choose squads of ten to travel to Paris and work in hospitals. Sam drew this duty and was put in charge of guarding a narcotics dispensary. <br><br>Sometimes he was sent through the pungent wards to deliver a dose of morphine to a nurse, and the things he saw on these errands aged him. The amputations, the groaning, the smell of infection and illness were proof of how little he knew about the meanness of warfare. At the end of each day, he felt humbled and simple. Sometimes he and his contingent would walk to a caf� where there was a very bad piano, and Sam would practice for an hour straight. The men didn&#x2019;t talk about the things they had seen in the wards, because all of it was beyond words. Sam was afraid that talking about it would make pictures stick in his head forever. They all worked in the ward for those too sick to move, and it was so huge that the ten of them combined had never seen half of it, much less the satellite buildings and compounds. There were French hospitals. English hospitals. American hospitals. Nothing in the patriotic posters or sheet music hinted at the blown- away jawbones, the baked eyeballs, or the trembling black rubber tubes dripping pus.<br><br>Eventually, because he could speak Cajun French, which to the Parisians sounded like a very bad seventeenth- century patois from the south of France, he was asked to perform some rudimentary interpreting. But every Frenchman he talked to raised his eyebrows in alarm, studied his pleasant face, and asked which colony he came from.<br>In January he was pulled off hospital duty and teamed up with eight fellow Louisianans under the Indiana lieutenant, for battlefield cleanup in the Argonne. They were told they were going to a forest, and Robicheaux picked up his rifle and said, &#x201c;Hot damn, maybe we can shoot us a deer and get some good meat.&#x201d; But days later, when they jumped off the muddy, open truck, they saw a dead and ice- glazed countryside convulsed with shell craters and stippled with exploded trees, a vast, botched junkscape of shot- apart wagons, upended tanks, and frost- etched ordnance of every description. They were given a map and told to police two square miles of it.<br><br>Sam stepped off the frozen track and his boot broke through a crust of ice, sinking deep into a foul- smelling brook. He pulled free and looked back at his lieutenant, tall, pale- eyed, barely there, his boyish midwestern face full of obedience and confusion.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, what exactly do they want us to do?&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant put a foot up on an abandoned water- cooled machine gun. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s pretty simple. We should look for the most dangerous ordnance and detonate it.&#x201d; His voice was thin, and Sam remembered hearing that he was highly educated and had never seen combat. They all looked over the immense battlefield, unable to comprehend any of it. Even in the cold, a stink rose out of the earth, and bristling everywhere were rusted hummocks of barbed wire.<br><br>They set up a camp of sorts, erecting a small tent for their supplies, and two hours after they&#x2019;d arrived, a plodding noise came from the west, and they turned to see the head of an infantryman rise up from a steep swale and then the rest of him, his right hand towing the reins of five saddled horses over the remnant of a road. He plodded on deliberately&#x2014; like a horse himself, and stopped next to the truck. &#x201c;I have orders to let you have these here animals,&#x201d; he drawled.<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth for?&#x201d; the lieutenant asked.<br><br>The soldier shrugged. &#x201c;Each demolition group gets a team.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam pointed over the chaos of no- man&#x2019;s- land. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t expect us to ride these out there, do they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good idea!&#x201d; the lieutenant exclaimed, his face brightening. He dismissed the soldier and took the reins, tying them to the truck&#x2019;s side rails. &#x201c;From horseback you&#x2019;ll be able to find the shells much better. That&#x2019;s the first thing to go after. The big projectiles. We can stack them and blow them up.&#x201d; He gestured toward the truck bed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been sent out with a detonator, electrical wire, and cases of dynamite.&#x201d; Sam had been issued a pair of field glasses and was studying a hill to the north, his stomach heavy with foreboding. &#x201c;What about the grenades? They&#x2019;re out there like gravel.&#x201d; He put down the glasses and looked over at the lieutenant.<br><br>&#x201c;I know enough not to handle them. Some might go off with just a nudge. I think we should try shooting them with our Springfields.&#x201d;<br><br>Melvin Robicheaux took off his helmet. &#x201c;Will that set them things off ?&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant raised his shoulders and turned up his hands. &#x201c;Pick one and shoot at it. Sort of an experiment.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam again peered through his field glasses. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant rose up on the balls of his feet. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give it a try.&#x201d;<br><br>Robicheaux got his rifle from the rear of the truck and worked the bolt. He glanced over his shoulder. &#x201c;Them horses, they been in the fightin&#x2019; or they like us?&#x201d;<br><br>The lieutenant turned toward the animals. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d guess the gimpy pair and that one with the scarred rump are veterans. The others, I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe they just came up from a transport.&#x201d; He turned, put his hands behind his back, and looked up the hill. &#x201c;Go ahead and shoot one.&#x201d;<br><br>Robicheaux adjusted the sights of the rifle, aimed at a grenade on the lip of a shell crater seventy yards away, and fired. He missed, but at the crack of the rifle one of the horses whinnied and reared, pulling loose from the truck and taking off in a zigzag gallop across the galled field and up the hill. Sam grabbed the bridles of two of the shying horses, and the other pair stood steaming in the light snow as if nothing at all had happened. The men watched the spooked horse run up the far rise for half a mile, dodging stumps and jumping craters and then stepping on God knows what, disappearing at once in a monstrous pink fireball. The ear- flattening concussion roared back across the field like a clap of thunder and they all ran behind the truck, scanning the sky for falling debris.<br><br>Once the sound of the explosion had echoed away, the lieutenant turned around and pointed to Dupuis, the only veteran among them. &#x201c;What did that animal step on?&#x201d;<br><br>Dupuis, a dour older man from Arnaudville, said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Cap. I been here a whole year and don&#x2019;t understand none of it.&#x201d;<br><br>A twenty- pound piece of shrapnel came straight down out of the clouds and banged through the hood of the truck. Crouched next to a tire, Sam stared at where the horse had been vaporized and then up at the sky, unable to imagine this cause- and- effect, the power involved, or what they were doing here. Up on the hill, a crater smoked like an entrance to a burning mine.<br>They fanned out over the blasted countryside shooting at grenades, about half of which exploded. Sam adjusted his sights and began setting off German stick grenades that went up with earcutting thuds, both dull and sharp at the same time. After an hour he felt something like a hammer blow on his helmet. Examining a long coppery crease, he guessed it was caused by a stray shot from another man&#x2019;s rifle, for other teams were working adjacent quadrants. After that, he worked in the low places, sighting in from the edge of trenches. Walking along a poisoned trickle of a stream, the water blue and stinking, he looked up the bank and saw a thighbone protruding from the earth. Downstream five German helmets sat as inert as dead turtles. Farther on he saw a mortar hitched to a team of killed horses frozen hard in their harness, and his thoughts began to balk against the math of the place; there were enough unexploded grenades of all nationalities to keep him busy for a hundred years. The smell was a walking presence and a mockery of what he had imagined of war, now blasted out of his mind forever. He understood how brutally the illusion of warfare had ended for the hundreds of thousands who&#x2019;d struggled here. &#x201c;What a damned lie,&#x201d; he said aloud. Climbing out of the stream, he worked the bolt and fired at a French pear grenade, which tumbled away but didn&#x2019;t detonate.<br><br>Suddenly an infantryman raised his head over the next hillock.<br><br>&#x201c;Son of a bitch, didn&#x2019;t they give you a compass? You&#x2019;re not supposed to fire to the northwest.&#x201d;<br><br>They walked toward each other until only a naked ravine graveled with spent machine- gun casings separ...</p><h2>Exile (Garnethill, 2)</h2><p>"Stunning. . . .

It looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggy may be a member of the family for a long&nbsp;&nbsp;time, possibly forever. Vicky remembers the happy&nbsp;&nbsp;times and finally accepts that things will never be&nbsp;&nbsp;the same, but she wonders what's to come.</p><p>Reading award-winning author Madeleine L'Engle's <i>Meet the Austins</i> is like taking a vacation with the warm, compassionate Austins--an extraordinary family who takes a little girl named Maggy Hamilton under its wing when her father is killed in a plane accident. Adjusting to a new household member is not easy, as the 12-year-old narrator, Vicky, will testify. Maggy is spoiled, "ubiquitous," laughs in a "horrid, screechy way," and appears to be a child of an entirely different species from the thoughtful, intelligent, kind, yet not cloyingly so, Austin kids. Still, Vicky and her other siblings (Rob, Suzy, and John) grit their collective teeth and struggle to understand her, which becomes easier and easier as the loving family seems to rub off on the newly orphaned Maggy.<p> The Austins are beyond question a charming family, but their path is by no means rock-free: Vicky sneaks off to a friend's house and severely injures herself in a bike accident, they all get the measles, John is beat up after his guest sermon in church, and they almost lose little Rob. Despite ordinary family setbacks, there's no use pretending this is a run-of-the-mill family. When Vicky is sick, her older brother, John, comes into her room and soothes her with a discussion of the solar system, our atomic composition, and the relativity of size. Family dinner-table talk includes the ethics of meat eating, and a chat with Grandfather ends up with a discussion of whether Einstein believed in God. As in all of L'Engle's novels, she asks the big questions: What is the meaning of life, and how does death fit into that? Are there different kinds of intelligence? What happens when you remove a screw from a radiator? This strangely comforting novel, first published in 1960, is an ALA Notable Book, and was followed by four other books featuring the Austin Family: <i>The Moon by Night</i>, <i>The Young Unicorns</i>, <i>A Ring of Endless Light</i> (a Newbery Honor Book), and <i>Troubling a Star</i>. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p><p><b>Madeleine L'Engle</b> (1918-2007) was the Newbery Medal-winning author of more than 60 books, including the much-loved <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>. Born in 1918, L'Engle grew up in New York City, Switzerland, South Carolina and Massachusetts. Her father was a reporter and her mother had studied to be a pianist, and their house was always full of musicians and theater people. L'Engle graduated cum laude from Smith College, then returned to New York to work in the theater. While touring with a play, she wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain</i>, originally published in 1945. She met her future husband, Hugh Franklin, when they both appeared in <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. </p><p>Upon becoming Mrs. Franklin, L'Engle gave up the stage in favor of the typewriter. In the years her three children were growing up, she wrote four more novels. Hugh Franklin temporarily retired from the theater, and the family moved to western Connecticut and for ten years ran a general store. Her book <i>Meet the Austins</i>, an American Library Association Notable Children's Book of 1960, was based on this experience. </p><p>Her science fantasy classic <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was awarded the 1963 Newbery Medal. Two companion novels, <i>A Wind in the Door</i> and <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i> (a Newbery Honor book), complete what has come to be known as The Time Trilogy, a series that continues to grow in popularity with a new generation of readers. Her 1980 book <i>A Ring of Endless Light</i> won the Newbery Honor. L'Engle passed away in 2007 in Litchfield, Connecticut.</p></p><h2>The Christian&#39;s Secret of a Happy Life</h2><p>This book was originally published prior to 1923, and represents a reproduction of an important historical work, maintaining the same format as the original work.

Quentin Meillassoux, author of <i>After Finitude</i>, continues his philosophical interrogation of the concepts of chance, contingency, infinity, and eternity through a concentrated study of Mallarm�'s poem &#x201c;Un Coup de D�s,&#x201d; patiently deciphering its enigmatic meaning on the basis of a dazzlingly simple and lucid insight with regard to Mallarm�'s &#x201c;unique Number.&#x201d;</p><p>The decisive point of the investigation proposed by Meillassoux comes with a discovery, unsettling and yet as simple as a child's game.

Tracing China&#39;s immensely rich artistic and cultural history, the reader will be introduced to the many art forms produced in China during the long time-span covered by this ancient civilization: from the early ritual jades crafted in the Neolithic period and the bronzes cast to honor ancestors in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, to the splendor of Buddhist art, the delicacy of porcelain wares, to the aesthetic principles underlying Chinese traditional painting. Well-known masterpieces, such as the terracotta army buried in the 3rd century BC near the tomb of the First Emperor, are discussed and illustrated alongside lesser-known but equally fascinating works of art, such as the Buddhist wall paintings of the Dunhuang caves in Gansu province or the artifacts recovered from Liao period tombs (AD 907-1125). Each chapter is accompanied by a thorough analysis of one &#39;masterpiece&#39; considered to be representative of the period under examination, while the works of art are analyzed within a larger cultural and social perspective, in order to provide the reader with a full account of the major achievements attained by China in the realm of the arts. Filled with stunning images and written by authors who have a long experience in the field, this single volume fills a gap in the literature on the subject. Despite the many books published on the art of China, few are in fact conceived as an organic, comprehensive introduction to this subject. Chinese Art is an invaluable addition.</p><p></p><h2>The Main Corpse</h2><p>She has been called "the Julia Child of mystery writers."

She shifts and warbles in the dark yard, her pink sheen caught in moonlight. I wonder if she&#x2019;s looking up at the spread of stars or if she&#x2019;s facing the farmhouse, watching us. Maybe things like her don&#x2019;t have eyes. Maybe they wander, unseeing, through the world.</p><p>At the edge of the clearing, the sudden shuffle and bob of branches draw my eyes from the ghost. A couple of giggly sophomores I recognize break through the brush and hesitate, half-shadowed, as they scour the hilltop our house sits on.</p><p>They look right past the shimmering pink spirit and focus instead on the cherry tree that sprawls out in front of our porch. The tree&#x2019;s as old as the town itself, planted by my great-great-great- great-grandfather, Jonathan &#x201c;Jack&#x201d; Alroy O&#x2019;Donnell, when he first settled here. He, like Dad, could talk roots into spreading anywhere, but part of the reason Jonathan stayed in Five Fingers was the taste of the cherries that grew on this hill.&nbsp;<i>Like heaven on earth</i>, Dad used to say,&nbsp;<i>like the silent world before anything had gone wrong.</i></p><p>Within months of his arrival, Jonathan had started a farm a couple of miles from here, closer to the water, where the earth mixed with sand. For two generations, the O&#x2019;Donnells built a legacy of roots and branches. It&#x2019;s been four more since the Angerts, my family&#x2019;s mortal enemies, foreclosed on the farm. But the cherries from that land are still sold in grocery stores and farmers&#x2019; markets, at festivals and fairs, beneath hand-painted signs and vinyl banners reading jack&#x2019;s tart.</p><p>The sophomores, Molly Malone and Quincy Northbrook, run toward the tree now, folded in half like they&#x2019;re trying not to block a movie-theater screen. Neither of them sees the ghost, but they both shiver as they pass through her, and Molly stops and glances back. Quincy&#x2019;s halfway up the tree, trying to shake down the empty branches. He hisses at Molly, and she runs to stand below him, folding her shirt up like a grocery bag as a few shriveled cherries drop.</p><p>Gravel crunches then, and headlights swing up the curve of our long driveway. In the tree, Quincy freezes like a raccoon caught robbing a trash can, but Molly&#x2019;s already running, halfway back to the woods with her spoils. At the breathy honk of the car horn, Quincy drops from the branches and takes off full tilt after her.</p><p>Hannah rolls the Subaru&#x2019;s window down and shouts, &#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s right! You&#x2019;d better run, punks!&#x201d; She shakes her head in mock disapproval then looks up at me, affecting surprise. &#x201c;But soft!&#x201d; she calls. &#x201c;What light through yonder window breaks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I yell back.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait. June? You&#x2019;re positively glowing. I thought that was the east and you were the sun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m ovulating. Common mistake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, get those incandescent ovaries down here. We&#x2019;ve got death traps and deep-fried John Doe waiting for us.&#x201d;</p><p>I pull on my canvas tennis shoes, swing my leather backpack over my shoulder, and flick the lights off. But something makes me take one last look at my room from the hallway, at the wild constellations of green star stickers Dad and I tacked on my ceiling when I was six years old. I&#x2019;d been sure back then they&#x2019;d glow forever&#x2014;that nothing Dad touched could dim.</p><p>Mom even used to say, &#x201c;June, your daddy&#x2019;s the sun.&#x201d;</p><p>And he was. He could make anything grow. He warmed every room he stepped into. When he touched an animal, it would lie down and nap. He even went away in the winter, like the sun so often did, and without him the house became cold, lethargic.</p><p>It&#x2019;s been almost ten years since he died, and not a single star sticker still glows. But some people are too alive to fully die, their stories too big to disappear, and he was one of them. I see traces of him all over our magic house. I hear him in the creak and groan of the floorboards as the summer nights stretch them, can visualize him sitting at the foot of my bed, saying,&nbsp;<i>Other houses have support beams and foundations. Ours has bones and a heartbeat.</i></p><p>I close my eyes and listen to the house hum and yawn, stretch and curl. Outside, Hannah honks, and I close the door and jog downstairs.</p><p>In the soft light of the kitchen, Mom and Toddy, my stepdad, are laughing and tickling each other like freshmen on a first date while they choose a bottle of white wine from the fridge. Shadow and Grayson are in the living room, standing on the couch, playing a gladiator video game with motion sensors.</p><p>&#x201c;Han&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; I announce, and Grayson screams something like <i>katchaaaaaaw&nbsp;</i>over my words and kicks the air.</p><p>Mom yelps with laughter and squirms in Toddy&#x2019;s arms, turning her sparkly Torch Lake eyes on me. Dad always said they were the first part of her he fell for. They met far away from here, but she was a little piece of home to him, so he swept her up and brought her back with him, because he wanted all the home he could have in one place.</p><p>Mom smooths her T-shirt down over her improbably toned stomach. &#x201c;Tell Hannah hi!&#x201d;</p><p>Toddy wraps her waist in his arms and rests his chin on her head. &#x201c;Go anywhere else after the carnival and you need to let us know, Junie,&#x201d; he adds. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you girls get in any trouble.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d;&nbsp;</i>I feign indignation and turn down the narrow hall for the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Love you, baby,&#x201d; they both call.</p><p>Outside, the throng of moths surrounding the porch light disperses around me. The hens, as usual, are asleep in the grass beyond the decrepit chicken coop, no cares in the world. As I slide into Hannah&#x2019;s passenger seat, everything feels particularly&nbsp;<i>right&nbsp;</i>in a way I can&#x2019;t explain. Like the whole world&#x2019;s in harmony.</p><p>The house, the woods, the hens. Hannah in her floral minidress and me in my ratty summer tank top and shorts. The spirit.</p><p>I scan the yard for any hint of the wobbly pink thing. &#x201c;Saw the ghost,&#x201d; I tell Hannah.</p><p>Hannah pops a piece of gum into her mouth then holds the pack out for me. &#x201c;Which one?&#x201d;</p><p>The cozy pink presence isn&#x2019;t the only one that has drifted across our yard since before I was born. &#x201c;Feathers,&#x201d; I answer.</p><p>Hannah chews on her lip. &#x201c;Good.&#x201d;</p><p>The other ghost&#x2014;the shadowy one we haven&#x2019;t named, that plume of darkness that makes you feel nauseated and cold if you brush against it&#x2014;only ever appears before something bad happens. Even when we hadn&#x2019;t actually seen the blackish thing, we&#x2019;d know it had been there because all the animals on our land would freak. The always serene hens would flap, peck, break their wings, sometimes even kill one another. The normally merciful coywolves would mutilate rabbits and sparrows and leave their uneaten bodies on our hillside, scatterings of grisly omens. The last time it came was three years ago, the night before our porch collapsed and I broke my foot, but I haven&#x2019;t actually seen the dark ghost in ten years.</p><p>Not since before the worst Bad Thing.</p><p>Hannah starts to reverse down the hill and into the woods. &#x201c;Ugh, your house always makes me feel the feelings. I swear, there&#x2019;s no place more nostalgia inducing than that leaning stack of lumber.&#x201d;</p><p>I nod and look out the window.</p><p>&#x201c;Is she here now?&#x201d; Hannah asks as she reverses slowly down the driveway. &#x201c;Feathers?&#x201d;</p><p>I point out toward a curve in the edge of the forest where I can barely make out a pink tendril caught in moonlight. &#x201c;There,&#x201d; I tell Hannah. She gazes out toward that point with a dreamy, contented smile, then returns to easing down the driveway. &#x201c;I wish you could see her.&#x201d;</p><p>Hannah lifts one shoulder in a shrug. &#x201c;I just like knowing she&#x2019;s there. You know, not everyone gets to be best friends with someone who has a guardian . . . ghost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Han, if she were my guardian ghost, don&#x2019;t you think she would&#x2019;ve intervened when I got bangs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who says guardian ghosts don&#x2019;t have a sense of humor?&#x201d;</p><p>When we were little, I saw the pink ghost all the time. Hannah couldn&#x2019;t, but she could&nbsp;<i>feel&nbsp;</i>it. Sometimes we&#x2019;d chase the shimmer across the yard and run through it, as if it were the spray of the sprinkler. It felt soft and lush, like running through a million falling feathers, thus our nickname for it. Dad always called it the Sprite, and when Mom shot him dubious looks&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>you shouldn&#x2019;t toy with the kids like that</i>&#x2014;he&#x2019;d wink and say, &#x201c;You know, L�a, to enter the kingdom of heaven, you must become like a child.&#x201d;</p><p>Then she&#x2019;d smile as she turned back to hanging laundry, or rolling dough over the floured counter, or trailing her fingers along the gauzy wind-rippled drapes, and say, &#x201c;Five Fingers loves its stories.&#x201d; Like most transplants to this place, Mom had a hard time accepting the strange things that happened on our land as anything other than the shared imaginings of wild, summer-dazed minds and a town-wide tendency to exaggerate.</p><p>Five Fingers&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>love its stories, but Dad&#x2019;s were true. Our house&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>magic, in some small way. The skinny halls and wallpapered rooms, the gnarled forest that encircled our hill&#x2014;together they do all kinds of impossible things. My whole life kids have crept onto our property at night to make wishes and look for spirits, or to steal cherries from the first Jack&#x2019;s Tart tree with hopes of shrinking their dogs&#x2019; tumors, healing their grandparents&#x2019; melanoma, even clearing up their acne.</p><p>As we pull onto the wooded road beyond my driveway, something flutters in my peripheral vision: the shift of a shadow, the undulation of something inky in front of the gatehouse.</p><p>My blood chills. My stomach clenches, a knot tightens my throat, and there&#x2019;s a jarring halt in my heart. But when I glance in the rearview mirror, there&#x2019;s nothing there. No shadowy thing, no darkness.</p><p><i>It&#x2019;s gone</i>, I tell myself.&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s been gone three years. It&#x2019;s not coming back.</i></p><p>Hannah flicks the frayed edge of my jean cut-offs.&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;</i>June?&#x201d; &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You okay? You look sort of . . . not.&#x201d;</p><p>I shake my head. &#x201c;Sorry, just distracted.&#x201d;</p><p><i>It&#x2019;s gone.</i></p><p>Still, tonight&#x2019;s feeling of rightness has been disturbed. Something&nbsp;<i>off&nbsp;</i>buzzes in the air, like a single hornet circling my head, always out of sight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Two</b></p><p>WE leave Hannah&#x2019;s car parked by Meijer and join the crowd rollicking across the highway toward the high school. The organ music playing on loop in the Tunnel O&#x2019; Love overlaps chaotically with the&nbsp;<i>whoop&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>dingdingding&nbsp;</i>of carnival games, and sweet, fatty smells mingle with the pine in the air.</p><p>We follow the curling path to the red-and-white ticket booth at the entrance to the school&#x2019;s parking lot, and I try to leave behind any thoughts of the dark presence I imagined back at the house.&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s gone; it&#x2019;s not coming back. It was never there.</i></p><p>Hannah squeezes my arm and squeals in excitement as we step into the ticket line. She may be painfully shy, but she loves crowds.</p><p>Our friendship couldn&#x2019;t be any more of a teen-TV-drama clich� if we tried: Hannah Kuiper is a shy yet extroverted, violin-playing salutatorian. I&#x2019;m a socially comfortable yet severely introverted underachiever who, if given the option for a weekend excursion, would choose Desert Island over Theme Park. She&#x2019;s a waify, blue- eyed blonde, and I&#x2019;m a dark-eyed, even darker-waved brunette who wore Hannah&#x2019;s current pant size back in the seventh grade. Mom attributes my relative brawn to the fact that I, like Dad, never stop moving.</p><p>As we near the front of the line, Han rises up on her tiptoes, searching the crowd beyond the booth. &#x201c;I think I see Nate Baars,&#x201d; Hannah says.</p><p>&#x201c;How,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;in this writhing mass of Vineyard Vines shorts and North Face fleeces, did you pick out one little Vineyard Tendril&#x2013;North Freckle?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are people crowded around him like that?&#x201d; she asks, completely ignoring me. I squint and follow her gaze to the base of the Ferris wheel. Nate&#x2019;s standing with a dozen kids from our school, most of whom have already graduated.</p><p>&#x201c;Weird,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen people line up to hear someone make a fart noise with their armpit before. Is that Stephen Niequist with him?&#x201d; I gesture to the rail-thin blond boy in the grandpa cardigan, Hannah&#x2019;s academic rival.</p><p>She shrugs. &#x201c;Weirdly enough, they&#x2019;re friends.&nbsp;<i>No&nbsp;</i>idea what those two have to talk about, but I see Stephen&#x2019;s car at Nate&#x2019;s house all the time.&#x201d;</p><p>Nate and Hannah live on the same street. We used to ride bikes with him when we were kids, before the natural current of high school took him and us in two very different directions. One direction being distinctly&nbsp;<i>toward&nbsp;</i>flatulence-based humor.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe the world&#x2019;s ending and Nate just found out he&#x2019;s allowed to choose one person to save,&#x201d; I suggest. Truthfully, Nate is&nbsp;<i>exactly</i> the kind of boy who might draw a crowd&#x2014;he&#x2019;s all suntanned muscle and shiny, chocolaty hair&#x2014;if he weren&#x2019;t so ridiculous. But he is, and so this visual makes no sense.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he won the lottery,&#x201d; Hannah says, &#x201c;and now he has fifty new best friends who want a piece of the pie.&#x201d;</p><p>The gaunt woman in the admission booth calls us forward, and we trade twenties for highlighter-pink wristbands. We wander partway down the aisle on the right and stop before the House of Mirrors, staring up at the pink archway over the entrance. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Hannah says gently, taking my hand. She juts her chin toward it. &#x201c;Maybe this year?&#x201d;</p><p>The House of Mirrors was always Dad&#x2019;s favorite, and it&#x2019;s mine too. There&#x2019;s something so thrilling about wandering around only to get yourself un-lost&#x2014;especially when the thing you&#x2019;re lost in blurs the line between dream and reality, possible and impossible. Like our house and our land. Like Dad himself.</p><p>Hannah and I come to this carnival every year, but I haven&#x2019;t been into the House of Mirrors since Dad died.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; Hannah says, studying me.</p><p>I shake my head. Hannah squeezes my hand then lets go. &#x201c;Maybe next year.&#x201d;</p><p>We stand in silence for a few more seconds, like we&#x2019;re at an altar or a grave and not five feet from a game where you shoot plastic clowns with mounted water guns.</p><p>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; Hannah says, breaking the reverie. I glance sidelong at her. Her eyes are back on the group at the bottom of the Ferris wheel. Now that we&#x2019;re closer, it&#x2019;s apparent that Nate is not, in fact, the center of their attention. He and Stephen are standing off-center, a little bit behind the others, and as a gaggle of middle schoolers jostles past, a gap in the group shifts to reveal the person they all seem uniformly focused on. At first, I can only see his back. He&#x2019;s on the tallish side of average and the thinnish side too, but he somehow takes up more space than someone his size should, as if his presence bends everything around itself.</p><p>He turns a bit, and I get a partial view of his profile but I still don&#x2019;t recognize him. Clean-cut dark hair, uniform five-o&#x2019;clock shadow. A T-shirt whiter than I&#x2019;ve managed to keep one in the time it takes to get from the cash register to the door. The kind of dark, slim-fi jeans you can get away with wearing to a Fiv...</p></p><h2>Come Back to Me</h2><p>In this heart-wrenching tale of love and loss, a young Marine and his best friend&#x2019;s sister plunge into a forbidden love affair while he&#x2019;s home on leave.<br><br><i>When a Marine Chaplain knocks on her door, Jessa&#x2019;s heart breaks&#x2014;someone she loves is dead.

I&#x2019;m halfway down the stairs, gathering my hair into a ponytail, thoughts a million miles away, when a blur outside the window pulls me up short.<br> <br>I take another step, the view clears, and when I realize what I&#x2019;m seeing, who I&#x2019;m seeing, my stomach plummets and the air leaves my lungs like a final exhalation. My arms fall slowly to my sides. My body&#x2019;s instinct is to turn and run back upstairs, to tear into the bathroom and lock the door, but I&#x2019;m frozen. This is the moment you have nightmares about, play over in your mind, the darkest of daydreams, furnished by movies and by real-life stories you&#x2019;ve overheard your whole life.<br> <br>You imagine over and over how you&#x2019;ll cope, what you&#x2019;ll say, how you&#x2019;ll act when you open the door and find them standing there. You pray to every god you can dream up that this moment won&#x2019;t ever happen. You make bargains, promises, desperate barters. And you live each day with the murmur of those prayers playing on a loop in the background of your mind, an endless chant. And then the moment happens and you realize it was all for nothing. The prayers went unheard. There was no bargain to make. Was it your fault? Did you fail to keep your promise?<br> <br>Time seems to have slowed. Kit&#x2019;s father hasn&#x2019;t moved. He&#x2019;s standing at the end of the driveway staring up at the house, squinting against the early morning glare. He&#x2019;s wearing his Dress Blues. It&#x2019;s that fact which registered before all else, which told me all I needed to know. That and the fact that he&#x2019;s here at all. Kit&#x2019;s father has never once been to the house. There is only one reason why he would ever come.<br> <br>He hasn&#x2019;t taken a step, and I will him not to. I will him to turn around and get back into the dark sedan sitting at the curb. A shadowy figure in uniform sits at the wheel. Please. Get back in and drive away. I start making futile bargains with some nameless god. If he gets back in the car and drives away, I&#x2019;ll do anything. But he doesn&#x2019;t. He takes a step down the driveway toward the house, and that&#x2019;s when I know for certain that either Riley or Kit is dead.<br> <br>A scream, or maybe a sob, tries to struggle up my throat, but it&#x2019;s blocked by a solid wave of nausea. I grab for the banister to stay upright. Who? Which one? My brother or my boyfriend? Oh God. Oh God. My legs are shaking. I watch Kit&#x2019;s father walk slowly up the drive, head bowed.<br> <br>Memories, images, words, flicker through my mind like scratched fragments of film: Kit&#x2019;s arms around my waist drawing me closer, our first kiss under the cover of darkness just by the back door, the smile on his face the first time we slept together, the blue of his eyes lit up by the sparks from a Chinese lantern, the fierceness in his voice when he told me he was going to love me forever.<br> <br>Come back to me. That was the very last thing I said to him. Come back to me.<br> <br>Always. The very last thing he said to me.<br> <br>Then I see Riley as a kid throwing a toy train down the stairs, dive-bombing into the pool, holding my hand at our grandfather&#x2019;s funeral, grinning and high-fiving Kit after they&#x2019;d enlisted. The snapshot of him in his uniform on graduation day. The circles under his eyes the last time I saw him.<br> <br>The door buzzes. I jump. But I stay where I am, frozen halfway up the stairs. If I don&#x2019;t answer the door, maybe he&#x2019;ll go away. Maybe this won&#x2019;t be happening. But the doorbell sounds again. And then I hear footsteps on the landing above me. My mother&#x2019;s voice, sleepy and confused. &#x201c;Jessa? Who is it? Why are you just standing there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Then she sees. She peers through the window, and I hear the intake of air, the ragged &#x201c;no&#x201d; she utters in response. She too knows that a military car parked outside the house at seven a.m. can signify only one thing.<br> <br>I turn to her. Her hand is pressed to her mouth. Standing in her nightdress, her hair unbrushed, the blood rushing from her face, she looks like she&#x2019;s seen a ghost. No. That&#x2019;s wrong. She looks like she is a ghost.<br> <br>The bell buzzes for a third time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get the door, Jessa,&#x201d; my mother says in a strange voice I don&#x2019;t recognize. It startles me enough that I start to walk down the stairs. I feel calmer all of a sudden, like I&#x2019;m floating outside my body. This can&#x2019;t be happening. It&#x2019;s not real. It&#x2019;s just a dream.<br> <br>I find myself standing somehow in front of the door. I unlock it. I open it. Kit. Riley. Kit. Riley. Their names circle my mind like birds of prey in a cloudless blue sky. Kit. Riley. Which is it? Is Kit&#x2019;s father here in his Dress Blues with his chaplain insignia to tell us that my brother has been killed in action or that his son&#x2014;my boyfriend&#x2014;has been killed in action? He would come either way. He would want to be the one to tell me. He would want to be the one to tell my mom.<br> <br>Kit&#x2019;s father blinks at me. He&#x2019;s been crying. His eyes are red, his cheeks wet. He&#x2019;s still crying, in fact. I watch the tears slide down his face and realize that I&#x2019;ve never seen him cry before. It automatically makes me want to comfort him, but even if I could find the words, my throat is so dry I couldn&#x2019;t speak them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jessa,&#x201d; Kit&#x2019;s father says in a husky voice.<br> <br>I hold on to the doorframe, keeping my back straight. I&#x2019;m aware that my mother has followed me down the stairs and is standing right behind me. Kit&#x2019;s father glances at her over my shoulder. He takes a deep breath, lifts his chin, and removes his hat before his eyes flicker back to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; I hear myself ask. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;</p><h2>Zinnia&#39;s Flower Garden</h2><p>Springtime is here, and Zinnia can&#x2019;t wait to plant her seeds and watch them grow.

Only one problem--at night, Chris doesn't feel so brave. He's afraid of the dark. <br>But when he watches the groundbreaking moon landing on TV, he realizes that space is the darkest dark there is--and the dark is beautiful and exciting, especially when you have big dreams to keep you company.</p><p><strong>Chris Hadfield</strong> is one of the most seasoned and accomplished astronauts in the world. In May 2013, Hadfield returned to Earth after serving as Commander of the International Space Station, where he and his crew lived for five months (his third mission). Chris frequently speaks to audiences throughout the US and Canada about space exploration and science education. <br><br><b>Terry Fan</b> received his formal art training at Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto. His work is a blend of traditional and contemporary techniques, using ink or graphite mixed with digital. He spends his days (and nights) creating magical paintings, portraits, and prints. Together with his brother Eric, he wrote and illustrated the critically-acclaimed picture book, <i>The Night Gardener.</i><br><br><b>Eric Fan</b> is an artist and writer who lives in Toronto, Canada. He attended the Ontario College of Art and Design where he studied illustration, sculpture, and film. He has a passion for vintage bikes, clockwork contraptions, and impossible dreams. His widely-praised debut picture book, <i>The Night Gardener</i>, was a collaboration with his brother Terry.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Canadian astronaut Hadfield presents an uplifting tale about a boy whose deep-rooted fears are eclipsed by the potency and possibility of his dreams for the future. It's July 1969, and Chris spends his days piloting his cardboard-box rocket, battling extraterrestrials, and voyaging to distant planets. But at night, fear of the dark has him seeing terrifying shadow aliens everywhere and seeking safety in his parents' bed. Everything changes when he watches the Apollo 11 moon landing on television and catches an awestruck glimpse of outer space, "the darkest dark ever." Later, unsettling shadows still occupy his unlit room, but Chris is different: with eyes newly opened to "the power and mystery and velvety black beauty of the dark," he can't wait to explore the night sky&#x2014;a dream that will always keep him company (and ultimately come true). Rendered in graphite and digitally colored in dusky hues, the luminous illustrations provide realistic portrayals of the action along with emotionally evocative depictions of the fantastical elements, from the just-menacing-enough coal black silhouettes of nighttime creatures to a wonder-filled dreamscape showing the pajama-clad space-helmeted boy (and his loyal pug companion) floating above his bed surrounded by stars and planets, rocket ships, and animals. Back matter includes a biography, a reassuring message from the author, and photos.

How you can meet and date the type of women you've always wanted and have effortless relationships! How to get a girlfriend. How to date multiple women. How to get your wife or girlfriend back. Turn your girl "friend" into your girlfriend. Live the life of your dreams &amp; accomplish your goals. How to get women to pursue you and approach you first, etc. My book covers both the dating world and long term relationships. You will learn how to meet and date the type of women you've always dreamed of. The best part is you can do this while remaining who you truly are inside. The book teaches you how to create sexual attraction in women &amp; get women to chase &amp; pursue you! It takes you step by step with easy to follow instructions. You will be able to meet women anytime, anyplace, &amp; anywhere... this will give you choice with women. Whether you are single &amp; searching, or already with your dream lady, my book has the secrets most men will never know about women... and... that women don't know about themselves. Why should you buy my book? Because it is the lowest cost and highest perceived value of any other eBook on the subject of pickup skills, dating and relationships. It offers more tips, strategies and techniques than any other book you will find. Unlike most other eBooks that only give you attraction and pick up techniques, my book will teach you how to successfully pickup up women anytime, anyplace and anywhere. Then it will teach you how to transition into dating, getting her to ask YOU to be HER boyfriend, and how to maintain a long term healthy and drama-free relationship free from nagging and arguments. I guarantee it will teach you more than any other book on the subject. PERIOD! What makes me qualified to help you? When I was younger and unsuccessful with women, I had a lot of life success (great career, very successful business, cars, toys, etc.), but when I went out on dates with women I really liked, I would get 2-3 dates max and then the women would never want to see me again, or they wanted to "just be friends." I was a total loser with women. I hated how that made me feel! Everyday I saw guys who were total losers and who had these hot women all over them. I thought... "These guys are no better than me." So I got serious about figuring this stuff out once and for all. I spent five years relentlessly learning, reading, researching, practicing, interviewing and hanging out with men who were really successful with women. Men who were naturally successful with women. The crazy thing was that many of these "naturals" with women were totally broke as a joke, and yet their women totally adored and worshiped them! As the light bulbs went off and I became better not only at modeling their success, but understanding the psychology of why they were successful, my own success really skyrocketed! I got good enough to meet and date a playboy model, a Miss Florida, a Miss America contestant and many other very high quality, gorgeous and successful women. Women who were previously "out of my league." If a regular guy like myself can do it, so can you! The good news is, once you understand the psychology of how a woman thinks, what she emotionally responds to, and what women really want in a man... any guy can duplicate my success. Even if you are not tall, rich or handsome! The "naturals" proved that to me over and over. After you finish reading my eBook, please go to my website and email me with your questions or sign up for my FREE newsletter :) Apply what I teach. It will work for you. From my heart to yours, Corey Wayne PS: If you're a woman, you will love the relationship wisdom in my book. You will learn things you did not even understand or know about yourself and how or why you have behaved in certain ways with certain men. You know the guys I'm talking about :)</p><p></p><h2>It&#39;s Okay to Be the Boss: The Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming the Manager Your Employees Need</h2><p>Do you feel you don't have enough time to manage your people? <p>Do you avoid interacting with some employees because you hate the dreaded confrontations that often follow?</p> <p>Do you have some great employees you really cannot afford to lose?</p> <p>Do you secretly wish you could be more in control but don't know where to start?</p> <p>Managing people is harder and more high-pressure today than ever before. There's no room for downtime, waste, or inefficiency. You have to do more with less. And employees have become high maintenance. Not only are they more likely to disagree openly and push back, but they also won't work hard for vague promises of long-term rewards. They look to you&#x2014;their immediate boss&#x2014;to help them get what they need and want at work.</p> <p>How do you tackle this huge management challenge? If you are like most managers, you take a hands-off approach. You "empower" employees by leaving them alone, unless they really need you. After all, you don't want to "micromanage" them and don't have the time to hold every employee's hand. Of course, problems always come up and often snowball into bigger problems. In fact, you probably spend too much of your time solving problems and falling behind on your work . . . which leaves even less time for managing people . . . which opens the door for even more problems!</p> <p>In <i>It's Okay to Be the Boss</i>, Bruce Tulgan puts his finger on the biggest problem in corporate America&#x2014;an undermanagement epidemic affecting managers at all levels of the organization and in all industries&#x2014;and offers another way. His clear, step-by-step guide to becoming the strong manager employees need challenges bosses everywhere to spell out expectations, tell employees exactly what to do and how to do it, monitor and measure performance constantly, and correct failure quickly and reward success even more quickly. Now that's how you set employees up for success and help them earn what they need. Tulgan opens our eyes to the undisciplined workplace that is overwhelming managers and frustrating workers and invites bosses everywhere to accept the sacred responsibility of managing people. His message: It's okay to be the boss. Be a great one!</p></p><p><p>Bruce Tulgan is an adviser to business leaders all over the world and a sought-after speaker and seminar leader. He is the founder of Rainmaker-Thinking, Inc., a management training firm. Bruce is the author of the classic <em>Managing Generation X</em> as well as <em>Winning the Talent Wars</em>, and has written for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, and <em>Human Resources</em>. He lives with his wife, Dr. Debby Applegate, in New Haven, Connecticut, and Portland, Oregon. </p>Tulgan, author and expert on Generation X workers (born between 1965 and 1977), considers what he calls the epidemic of "undermanagement" in corporate America--or, the failure of managers to take daily charge of the work environment and tell employees what to do and how to do it. He identifies seven big management myths, including there not being enough time to manage people; that to be fair, everyone should be treated the same; and the desire of managers to be "nice guys." Today's change in corporate culture from long-term employees working their way up the ranks to short-term workers in flattened organizations reporting to project managers who "empower" them leads to failure, because employees are not really free and managers are not trained. The author decries managers' lack of guidance, direction, feedback, and employee support, and he responds in this book with hands-on management advice that he clearly differentiates from micromanagement. The author tells us, "Taking the first step toward effective managing takes discipline and guts." An excellent book. <i>Mary Whaley</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She and her two daughters live in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>GOD, MIGHTY CREATOR ELOHIM The Name Elohim is the Hebrew word for God that appears in the very first sentence of the Bible. When we pray to Elohim, we remember that he is the one who began it all, creating the heavens and the earth and separating light from darkness, water from dry land, night from day. This ancient name for God contains the idea of God&#39;s creative power as well as his authority and sovereignty. Jesus used a form of the name in his agonized prayer from the cross. About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, &#39;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&#39;---which means, &#39;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#39; Key Scripture In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1) Monday GOD REVEALS HIS NAME In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, &#39;Let there be light.&#39; God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. And God said, &#39;Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.&#39; God called the dome Sky. And God said, &#39;Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.&#39; God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. Then God said, &#39;Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.&#39; And God said, &#39;Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night.&#39; And God said, &#39;Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.&#39; And God said, &#39;Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.&#39; Then God said, &#39;Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&#39; So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them, and God said to them, &#39;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.&#39; God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. (Selected from Genesis 1 NRSV) Elohim, Mighty One, you made everything out of nothing, imposed order on chaos, gave birth to beauty, and called it all good. Help me to know you as the one true God who created everything and everyone, the one who has placed me on the earth for a purpose---to magnify your name.Amen. Understanding the Name Elohim (e-lo-HEEM) is the plural form of El or Eloah, one of the oldest designations for divinity in the world. The Hebrews borrowed the term El from the Canaanites. It can refer either to the true God or to pagan gods. Though El is used more than 200 times in the Hebrew Bible, Elohim is used more than 2,500 times. Its plural form is used not to indicate a belief in many gods but to emphasize the majesty of the one true God. He is the God of gods, the highest of all. Christians may recognize in this plural form a hint of the Trinity---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Elohim occurs thirty-two times in the first chapter of Genesis. After that the name Yahweh appears as well and is often paired with Elohim and, in the NIV, the two together are translated &#39;the LORD God.&#39; Studying the Name 1. &#39;Genesis&#39; is a word that can mean &#39;birth,&#39; &#39;history of origin,&#39; or &#39;genealogy.&#39; What can you observe about who God is from this passage about beginnings? 2. What can you observe about the world he has made? 3. What do you think it means to be created in &#39;the image of God&#39;? How would your life change if you lived with the constant awareness that he created you to bear his image? 4. God seems delighted by what he has made, proclaiming it good and even very good. How does God&#39;s assessment of creation shape your own attitude toward the world? Toward yourself? GOD, MIGHTY CREATOR Tuesday PRAYING THE NAME Then God said,&#39;Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&#39; So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them, and God said to them,&#39;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.&#39; (Genesis 1:26--28 NRSV) Reflect On: Genesis 1:26--28 Praise God: For his power in creating the heavens and the earth out of absolutely nothing. Offer Thanks: That God has not only created you, but made you in his own image. Confess: Any tendency to forget that every human life, including your own, is sacred. Ask God: To renew your sense of wonder and gratitude for the things he has made. A mighty God could have created a world quite different from the one we know. It could have had perpetually dark skies, grass that hurt to walk on, dogs that couldn&#39;t be housebroken, and people incapable of love. Have you ever wondered why the world you take for granted is often so stunningly beautiful? So pleasant to live in? Why the people around you are capable of so much kindness? So often we miss life&#39;s beauty because we are preoccupied by its flaws. Instead of taking off our shoes to feel the feathery soft grass beneath our feet, we complain that it&#39;s growing so fast we don&#39;t have time to mow it. Rather than enjoying the gregarious woman behind the supermarket counter, we blame her friendly chatter for delaying the checkout line. And what about us? Who stares back from the mirror each morning? A child of God who is growing daily in his image or someone whose nose is too big or too small, whose hair is in a state of perpetual rebellion, or whose skin is aged and worn? Today, ask the God who made you to remake your sense of wonder at his creative power.</p><h2>Ultimate LEGO Star Wars</h2><p><p>The definitive guide to the LEGO� <i>Star Wars&#x2122;</i> universe, showcasing the vast collection of LEGO <i>Star Wars</i> sets and minifigures released over the last 20 years.</p><p>This is a complete, unrivaled encyclopedia of the LEGO <i>Star Wars</i> theme.

The precision of the killer's methods suggests he is a deranged man of medicine, propelling the Boston newspapers and the frightened public to name him "The Surgeon."<br><br>The cops' only clue rests with another surgeon, the victim of a nearly identical crime. Two years ago, Dr. Catherine Cordell fought back and killed her attacker before he could complete his assault. Now she hides her fears of intimacy behind a cool and elegant exterior and a well-earned reputation as a top trauma surgeon. <br><br>Cordell's careful facade is about to crack as this new killer recreates, with chilling accuracy, the details of Cordell's own ordeal. With every new murder he seems to be taunting her, cutting ever closer, from her hospital to her home. Her only comfort comes from Thomas Moore, the detective assigned to the case. But even Moore cannot protect Cordell from a brilliant hunter who somehow understands--and savors--the secret fears of every woman he kills.<br><br>Filled with the authentic detail that is the trademark of this doctor turned author . . . and peopled with rich and complex characters--from the ER to the squad room to the city morgue--here is a thriller of unprecedented depth and suspense. Exposing the shocking link between those who kill and cure, punish and protect, <i>The Surgeon</i> is Tess Gerritsen's most exciting accomplishment yet.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, August 2001:</b> Tess Gerritsen left a very successful career as an internist to raise her children and devote more time to writing. After several books that have had moderate success, Gerritsen has now written a gruesome and frightening story that should put her among the top women thriller writers working today.<p> A serial killer is on the loose in Boston. The victims are killed in a particularly nasty way: cut with a scalpel on the stomach, the intestines and uterus removed, and then the throat slashed. The killer obviously has medical knowledge and has been dubbed "the Surgeon" by the media. Detective Thomas Moore and his partner Rizzoli of the Boston Homicide Unit have discovered something that makes this case even more chilling. Years ago in Savannah a serial killer murdered in exactly the same way. He was finally stopped by his last victim, who shot him as he tried to cut her. That last victim is Dr. Catherine Cordell, who now works as a cardiac surgeon at one of Boston's prestigious hospitals. As the murders continue, it becomes obvious that the killer is drawing closer and closer to Dr. Cordell, who is becoming so frightened that she is virtually unable to function. But she is the only person who can help the police catch this copycat killer. Or is it a copycat? To complicate matters even further, Detective Moore, often referred to as Saint Thomas as he continues to mourn the loss of his wife, is getting emotionally involved with the doctor.</p><p> The suspense in <i>The Surgeon</i> is almost unbearable.

All lessons should be this gratifying." &#x2014;PUBLISHERS WEEKLY (starred review)</b><br><br>"Bang!" goes the gun. The race is on.<br><br>Eighty racers explode from the starting gate, determined to win The Great Divide. They surge ahead, rushing toward&#x2014;OH NO!&#x2014;the wide hungry mouth of a grand canyon that claims half the racers. And this is only the beginning. More dangers lie ahead, waiting to divide the group once, twice, three times, and more. Will there be anyone left to cross the finish line?</p><p>Dayle Ann Dodds is a former elementary school teacher with a degree in early childhood development. As she does in THE GREAT DIVIDE, Dayle Ann Dodds often writes in rhyme because "it is so natural to kids' ears. Rhyme, rhythm, and pattern help kids remember small revelations in entertaining stories," she says. Embedded in the exciting contest of THE GREAT DIVIDE, readers will find grouping, adding, subtracting, and multiplying, and discover how they form the foundation of division. Dayle Ann Dodds lives in Palo Alto, California.<br><br>Tracy Mitchell was born in Boston but grew up in New Orleans, a city whose influence is evident in her art style. THE GREAT DIVIDE is Tracy Mitchell's first picture book, and she says that working with such a large number of characters was just one of the many challenges she faced in creating her paintings for the book. "Dividing the racers into crazy groups, like clowns, pirates, and dancers, definitely helped," she says. Tracy Mitchell lives in Somerville, Massachusetts.In this crafty story of a cross-country race called "The Great Divide," numerical division accounts for the narrowing of the field. Eighty costumed competitors (in 10 groups of eight) begin the event on bicycles, but only half of them ford a rocky red canyon to continue: "On with the race./ Head for a boat!/ Forty racers now have to float!" These 40 (now 10 groups of four) climb aboard two big rowboats, and a whirlpool diminishes their number by half again. Dodds (Sing, Sophie!) continues reducing the group to 10 and to five, at which point "one runner stops with a rock in her shoe," enabling the final four to grab tandem bikes. The author demonstrates rather than describes the math, and her terse rhymes reinforce the racers' sense of urgency. Meanwhile Mitchell's individualized portraits of the athletes raise the book's quotient of pleasure. The illustrator, making a notable picture-book debut, carefully includes the dwindling number of eight clowns, eight cowhands, eight flappers, eight pirates and so on in her well-organized acrylic paintings; aspiring number crunchers can count the participants with ease. Among the top contenders, likable characters emerge: a jailbird wears a determined grin, a grandmotherly lady rides a galloping horse and a firefighter sticks out her tongue in exhaustion. All lessons should be this gratifying. Ages 5-10.

There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.<i>Chapter One<br></i>To Clifton House on the Canadian came a lone rider on a long-legged buckskin. He was a green-eyed man wearing a flat-crowned, flat-brimmed black hat, black shirt and chaps. The Barlow &amp; Sanderson Stage had just pulled in when the rider came out of the lava country, skirting the foothills of the Sangre de Cristos.<br><br>He was riding easy when they first saw him but his horse was dust-coated and the sweat had dried on him. The man had a tear in his shirt sleeve and a bloody bandage on his side. He rode directly to the stable and dismounted, caring first for his horse.<br><br>Only then did he turn and glance toward the House. He wore two tied-down guns. Pulling his hat lower he crossed the hard-packed earth and entered the house. "I could use some grub," he said, "a meal now and supplies to go."<br><br>"We got anything you need. We're feedin' the stage crowd now. Go on in."<br><br>He paused at the door and studied the room before going in. There were six passengers from the stage. Two women and four men, and there were a few riders from the valley roundup and three men from a trail herd crew. Face by face he studied them. Only then did he seat himself.<br><br>The tall girl from the stage lifted her eyes and looked across the table at him, her eyes alive with curiosity as she saw the bloody bandage. None of the men appeared to notice anything, and she filled her cup again and tried her coffee. It was hot, black, and strong.<br><br>Her eyes went again to the man in black. He had removed his hat when he seated himself and she noticed that his hair was black and curly. He was a lean, powerfully built man, probably larger than he looked while seated. Her eyes trailed again to the bandage.<br><br>"You . . . you've hurt yourself!" she exclaimed. "Your shoulder!"<br><br>Embarrassed and irritated, he glanced up. "It's a scratch," he said hastily. "It's all right."<br><br>"It looks like more than a scratch to me," she persisted. "You had better have it cared for."<br><br>"Thanks," he said, his voice a shade grim now, "I shall."<br><br>There was silence for a few minutes, and then from down the table somebody said, "Don't yuh wished yuh was scratched, Ike? Mebbe the lady would fix it for yuh."<br><br>The tall man flushed slightly but said nothing, but from down the table came a new voice. "Whatever it was scratched him," the voice said, "it looks like it hit him runnin' away!"<br><br>The dead silence that followed saw the tall man turn pale and cold. He lifted his head, his green eyes going down the table to the man who had spoken. He was a tough, handsome youngster with a look of eager recklessness about him. "If you were jokin'," the tall man said, "say so."<br><br>The man beside the tall man ducked suddenly and rolled off the bench, while others drew back from the blond young man. The youngster got slowly to his feet. "I wasn't jokin'," he said, with a faint sneer. "It looks to me like you was runnin' away."<br><br>As he spoke he went for his gun, and what happened then was seen with utter, piercing clarity by all who watched. The tall man seemed deliberately to wait, to hesitate the split second it took for the blond young man's hand to strike the butt of his gun. Then he palmed his own gun and shot.<br><br>The blond man staggered, his gun, half-drawn when the shot struck him, slid back into the holster. The man backed up, sat down, and rolled over on his face, coughing blood and death.<br><br>For an instant the room was still, broken by the young, woman. She stared with horror at the tall man. "You . . . you <i>murderer</i>!" she cried, her lips twisting.<br><br>The tall man drew back slightly, his gun still in his hand. From one man to the other, he looked. "You saw it. He asked for it. I didn't want to kill him. I wasn't hunting for trouble when I came here. I was just tryin' to eat a quiet meal. What did he want to jump me for?"<br><br>Nobody spoke for a few seconds and then an older man said quietly, "Don't blame yourself, stranger. The boy has been huntin' for trouble ever since he killed a man in Texas."<br><br>"That won't make no difference for yuh," another man said. "When Tetlow hears yuh've shot his boy, he'll never rest until he nails yore hide on the fence."<br><br>The tall man drew back and holstered his gun. "I'm not looking for trouble," he said. "I'll take my supplies and leave. Just you remember that," he added. "I'm not lookin' for trouble."<br><br>He sat down at the table and using his left hand he made two sandwiches from meat and bread. Wrapping them in a kerchief, he shoved them into his chaps pocket, backed away from the table, turned and walked into the other room. Tom Stockton was waiting for him. On the counter was a sack filled with supplies. "There it is, son. I seen it, an' it was a fa'r shootin' if there ever was one. Take this stuff, an' welcome."<br><br>"Thanks," the tall man hesitated, "but I want to pay."<br><br>"I'll take it hard," Stockton said grimly. "Yuh take this an' go along. It's little enough I can do for <i>Kilkenny</i>!"<br><br>Although he hissed the last name gently, the tall man looked quickly around. "Don't say that name!" he said. "Don't mention it!"<br><br>"<i>I</i> won't," Stockton replied, "but there's others in there may. Johnson," he nodded toward the dining room, "is from the Live Oak country. He may know yuh."<br><br>"Thanks again." Kilkenny turned, then he paused. "This Tetlow&#x2013;who is he?"<br><br>Tom Stockton leaned his big hands on the counter and his face was grave. He had established Clifton House in 1867 to serve the round-up crowds and it had become a stage station. Since then and before he had seen much of the West and he had known most of it before. He knew this young man both by reputation and by intuition, and he liked him, and knowing this man and knowing Tetlow&#x2013;<br><br>"It couldn't be worse. He's from Tennessee, Kilkenny, with all that means. He's the old bull o' the woods, a big, hard old man, but aristocratic, intelligent, smart, and a politician. Worse, he comes of a feuding family. He'll not rest until he gets you, or you him."<br><br>Kilkenny nodded. "I see. What's he doing here?"<br><br>"He's not here, not yet. But he's comin'. South of here on the flat he's got six thousand head of cattle. That's the second herd. The first one was four thousand head. He's got two more herds comin'."<br><br>"He'll need a lot of land for that many cattle," Kilkenny said. "I hope he's got it spotted."<br><br>"If he hasn't," Stockton replied, "he'll get it." He jerked his head. "That one, the one you shot. He was tall-talkin' around here. Said if they didn't get the land any other way they knew how they could get it. And he slapped his gun when he spoke."<br><br>"It's been done," Kilkenny said.<br><br>Stockton nodded gloomily. "Which makes it mighty tough on the little man who can't hire gunmen. Knowin' somethin' about Tetlow, however, I'd say that he wouldn't fall back on guns until politics failed. He's a smooth one, an' like I said&#x2013;he's a politician."<br>To the high valleys then, came a lone rider, a man who rode with the caution born of riding long on strange trails in a land untamed and restless with danger.<br><br>The Indian Wars were largely of the past, although there were still the Sioux, the Cheyenne, Nez Perc� and the Apache with fight left in them, but on the land from which the Indian had been driven or from which he was being driven the white man had not found peace&#x2013;or at best an uneasy peace when men rode with guns at hand and eyes alert for danger.<br><br>Cattle had come to replace the buffalo, and then bolder men had pushed their herds into the mountain valleys, valleys lush with grass that fattened cattle amazingly fast, and as these valleys began to be settled, some men drifted to the high meadows among the peaks.<br><br>Lonely, largely overlooked, but excellent grazing in spring, summer and early fall, the valleys were the last land to be taken. It was to one such valley that Kilkenny rode, and when he drew up and looked around him, he made his decision. This was the home he had been seeking, on this land would he stay.<br><br>Riding on, he studied the valley. To right and left lay towering ridges that walled the valley in, and to the east other peaks lifted, and west the valley swung hard around and at one corner the wall was broken sharply off to fall sheer away for more than six hundred feet. Kilkenny paused long upon the lip, looking out over that immeasurable distance toward the faraway line of the purple hills. It was then that he first became conscious of the sound, a faint scarcely discernible whispering. Holding himself erect, he listened intently. It was the wind! The whispering wind!<br><br>Wind among the tall pines, among the rocks and the erosion-gnawed holes, a sound such as he had never heard, a sound like far off music in which no notes could be detected, a sound so strange that he could not stop listening. He turned then in his saddle and looked back over the valley he had found. At least two thousand acres! Grassy and lush with growth, water aplenty, and that whispering! The valley of the whispering wind!<br><br>It was a strange thing to find this place now, this place where he knew he could find happiness, the place from which he would not move again. He had told himself that before he realized what it might mean, and when he did know, he nodded his head as if at last he could be sure.<br><br>Yes. Here he would stop. Here he would cease being the restless drifter that he had become, a man fleeing from a reputation, fleeing from the reputation of a killer. But in this place he would stay, and he would find peace-if they let him.<br><br>There was always the chance that some stranger from the plains might drift into the country and recognize him as Kilkenny, yet he was fortunate in that few men knew him well, and most descriptions of him were mistaken. There was always the chance of such a killing as the affair at Clifton's. That man had not even known who he was, just a trouble-hunting kid wanting to prove how tough he could be. But that was over, and it was miles away over some of the roughest land in the world. And here he would stay.<br><br>His fire was a lonely gleam in the vast darkness of the valley, and in the morning he saw where the cougars had come down from the rocks to investigate, and once he found the tracks of a grizzly. Killing a deer for food, he started in then to work. Living on the ground under the stars, he laid the foundations of his home, choosing flat stones from the talus of the ridges, carefully laying the foundation and the floor. When a space for three rooms was carefully laid, he crushed limestone, and with sand made a crude mortar and began building the walls from selected chunks of rock.<br><br>It was slow, bitterly hard work, but he enjoyed it, and during that first month in the high meadow there was no sound or sight of anything man had done but what he did with his own hands. While he worked, he thought carefully of what he would do now. The house was nearing completion, and he had cleaned the waterholes and walled up the spring near the cabin.<br><br>Soon he must go to a settlement for supplies and ammunition. He felt a curious hesitancy about that, for he had no desire to go. Always now he found himself remembering the queer horror on that girl's face after he had shot Tetlow. True, she did not understand what it meant. She was new to the West. Still, it was not pleasant to have one looked at with such horror.<br><br>Who was she? She was without doubt beautiful-very beautiful.<br><br>As beautiful as . . . ? He shook his head. No. There was no other like Nita, and there would be no other like her.<br><br>On the first day of the seventh week in the high meadow, Kilkenny saddled up and started for town. He knew nothing of the place. Horsehead, they called it, and while riding toward it he had heard it mentioned, but no more. He did not even know how to get there, but must find his way through the canyons.<br><br>Horsehead sprawled in lazy comfort along both banks of a creek called Westwater, and the town's main street crossed the creek at right angles. The ancient stone stage station, a veteran of Indian fighting and earlier Mormon settlement, stood near the east bank of the creek. It was a low-roofed, single-storied building with an awning that projected eight feet from the roof and offered shelter to a couple of initial-carved benches polished by the seats of many breeches.<br><br>Above the doorway was a crude sign lettered <i>Horsehead: Stage Station. Eat &amp; Drink</i>. Drinks were occasionally served over the tiny six-foot bar, but no meals had been served for six years. East of the stage station was the two-story Westwater Hotel &amp; Saloon, and it was here the elite usually ate. East of the hotel in lazy comfort were the Harness Shop, Eli Putnam, Prop.; the Barber Shop, the office of Robt. Early, Lawyer, and a scattering of other structures steadily declining in height until they reached the usual Last Chance Saloon.<br><br>Opposite the stage station was the sheriff's office and jail. The town marshal had a desk in the same office but no love was lost between the two men. Alongside the sheriff's office and facing the hotel was the assayer's office, and beyond it in a row were the Pinenut Saloon, the Emporium, the real estate office and then the Diamond Palace Saloon &amp; Gambling Hall and a trail of further buildings.<br><br>West of the creek was a section of town all by itself, and one largely ignored by the businesses and citizens who lived on the east bank. A grove of trees, mostly cottonwoods but mixed with willows and a scattering of others, occupied the immediate bank and partly shaded the bridge. Beyond the trees were the corrals and wagon yards of the livery stable, and then the huge and sprawling stable itself. Beyond the stable was the bunkhouse, which was a place for casual sleeping, and possessing no rooms, but merely a dozen tiers of bunks, two high, and a few tables.</p><h2>Number the Stars 25th Anniversary</h2><p><p>As the German troops begin their campaign to "relocate" all the Jews of Denmark, Annemarie Johansen&#x2019;s family takes in Annemarie&#x2019;s best friend, Ellen Rosen, and conceals her as part of the family.</p><p>Through the eyes of ten-year-old Annemarie, we watch as the Danish Resistance smuggles almost the entire Jewish population of Denmark, nearly seven thousand people, across the sea to Sweden.

Before we were born, we shared Mama&#x2019;s belly, splitting the resources so equally that we weighed the exact same amount at birth. The story of our arrival was our bedtime story for years and years. How the doctor didn&#x2019;t realize there were two of us until nine minutes after I was born, when you followed me into life. (How you have always loved a good surprise!) How in those nine minutes, Mama and Papa had already named me Annabelle. How they were so shocked at your arrival, they didn&#x2019;t think to come up with a second name. Instead, they split mine in two. I became Anna, you Belle.</p><p>Twelve years later, we share more than a name. To strangers, we&#x2019;re identical. We have the same straight brown hair cropped to the same place beneath our ears, the same gray-green eyes, the same pattern to our forehead wrinkles when we squint without our same-prescription glasses. We have the same height, the same weight, the same narrow heels that make buying shoes the same type of challenge. Save the mole on my left elbow that you lack, we are mirror replicas. So, like a name, we share our appearance.</p><p>We certainly don&#x2019;t share a personality. You are carefree and adventurous, while I am careful and cautious. You are quick to laugh, but also quick to cry. Your emotions flap back and forth like clothes drying on the line. We are both 12 but in many ways you are like our baby sister Mina, lashing out in anger in one moment, then jumping with delight the next, your hurt erased at the sight of something pretty.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t be angry at that comparison. You are the fun twin, the mischievous twin, the reckless and funny and passionate twin. I am the dull twin, the quiet twin, the responsible and reserved twin. I&#x2019;m more careful than you, and more deliberate. I compared you to Mina, but you always compare me to Oliver. That is a compliment as well. Oliver is only 4, but he&#x2019;s wiser than most adults. We all love his story too. How he had so many ear infections as a baby that Mama used to worry he wouldn&#x2019;t hear. How he now hears every whisper, and how nothing escapes his big blue eyes. We know it&#x2019;s more than that, however. He understands. People, ideas, feelings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s as though the tubes the doctor put in his ears made a path all the way to his heart. I am quiet like Oliver, and I like to think I share at least some of his intuition.</p><p>Of course I&#x2019;ve arrived back at sharing. With so many brothers and sisters, we know nothing besides sharing. Me, you, Oliver, Mina, Greta (who is every bit 9), and Kurt, now 14&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our house was quite full enough with 8 people. When the occupation pushed Grandmother and Grandfather to move in, it became nearly unbearable for us all. I know you too have wished to have something for yourself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a bed, a hairbrush, a whole potato, or an entire magazine. The only thing I&#x2019;ve ever had for me and me alone are my thoughts. I try to keep them for just me, but in that I even fail, for you, Belle, know me to my core. You speak for me and through me, and often (does this happen to you?) it&#x2019;s as though I don&#x2019;t know my own opinion until I hear you speak yours.&nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve often wished for some time alone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some moments, belongings, or experiences just for me. I wanted to be like the magician who performs at the Luxembourg Fair and make my 5 siblings, even you, even Oliver, vanish.</p><p>Now here I am, crossing the ocean, my wish come regrettably true. Who is vanishing, you or me?</p><p><b><br>Chapter 1</b><br>October 2014</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re invited!&#x201d;</p><p>Parker Applebaum dangled two postcards over the low shelves in the synagogue library. Even though I couldn&#x2019;t see her from my spot on the floor with Madeline, I knew it was Parker because there was a giant photo of her face taking up half the postcard. Madeline and I looked at each other and suppressed giggles. The picture looked like it was meant for a department store ad. Parker&#x2019;s long red hair was blowing in the wind, and her mouth was open in a hearty grin, like the photographer&#x2014;no doubt a professional one&#x2014;had caught her mid-laugh.</p><p>Madeline squinted at the postcard. &#x201c;Where are her braces?&#x201d;</p><p>Parker&#x2019;s actual face appeared over the bookshelf. &#x201c;Photoshopped out,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;This photographer&#x2019;s amazing. He doesn&#x2019;t usually do bat mitzvahs, but he&#x2019;s willing to do mine because we used him for my modeling portfolio. Let me know if you want his number. I can probably get you guys in too. <i>And</i>,&#x201d; Parker sang, her lips curling up, &#x201c;guess who else is invited.&#x201d; She cocked her head in the direction of the tables in the center of the library.</p><p>&#x201c;The whole class?&#x201d; Madeline deadpanned.</p><p>The corners of Parker&#x2019;s lips dropped. &#x201c;I was talking to Imani,&#x201d; she said. She smiled at me and did a double-raise of her eyebrows. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m inviting Ethan Bloom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, trying to sound casual. Ethan and I are both on our school tennis team, and ever since Parker heard him compliment my backhand a couple weeks ago, she&#x2019;s been convinced that he likes me. I&#x2019;m not as convinced. It&#x2019;s not like he complimented my serve (which stinks). Everyone compliments my backhand, because it&#x2019;s killer.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to sit you and Ethan at the same table,&#x201d; Parker said with some more eyebrow wiggling.</p><p>Mrs. Coleman&#x2019;s face appeared above Parker&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Girls,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Back to your projects, please.&#x201d;</p><p>Parker smiled and handed Mrs. Coleman a postcard. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re invited, Mrs. Coleman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;December sixth,&#x201d; our teacher said without needing to look. &#x201c;Will you have your haftorah ready by then? How about the research project you&#x2019;re supposed to be working on as we speak?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah.&#x201d; Parker rolled her eyes and reminded us, &#x201c;December sixth,&#x201d; before walking away.</p><p>Madeline and I went back to our Holocaust books. As if we didn&#x2019;t have to do enough to prepare for our bat mitzvahs (write a speech, know all the prayers, read nine lines of Torah, <i>sing </i>a long haftorah portion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.), we each had to research some aspect of the Holocaust. Like we hadn&#x2019;t heard enough about the Holocaust every year of our lives. I&#x2019;m usually pretty good about doing classwork, even for Hebrew school, but this assignment was seriously uninspiring. We couldn&#x2019;t even use the internet to look stuff up the easy way; Mrs. Coleman was making us use actual books, which was why our Hebrew school class had permanently relocated from a classroom to the synagogue library.</p><p>Not wanting to think about Ethan or my Holocaust project, I waited till Mrs. Coleman was out of earshot and then poked Madeline with Parker&#x2019;s postcard. &#x201c;Are you going to have your photo on your invitations?&#x201d; I whispered.</p><p>Madeline blew air through her lips, like a bike tire deflating. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. We&#x2019;re not even going to do paper invites; wastes too many trees.&#x201d;</p><p>Figures. Madeline&#x2019;s parents are green to the extreme.</p><p>&#x201c;When are you going to tell your parents what you want for your present?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>I sighed and leaned back into the bookshelf. Instead of having a blowout party for my bat mitzvah (like Parker) or a tasteful luncheon (like Madeline), I&#x2019;m going to get a big present. My parents said they&#x2019;d get me whatever gift I want, within reason. I know exactly what I want, but so far I&#x2019;ve only worked up the nerve to tell Madeline. I also told Madeline to make sure I don&#x2019;t chicken out of asking, and boy, was she keeping that promise.</p><p>&#x201c;Imani.&#x201d; She poked my arm with her pointer finger. &#x201c;Just tell them. They said you can have anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Within reason,&#x201d; I reminded her.</p><p>&#x201c;What could be more reasonable than wanting to know who you are?&#x201d; Madeline flipped through the pages of the book she was holding. It was full of old pictures of white people, emaciated, with sunken cheeks and resigned eyes. &#x201c;Remember when we used to look at that <i>Children of the World</i> book? The one with the people from all different countries?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; I said, as though just now remembering. &#x201c;You used to hold it up next to me and try to see which country my ancestors might be from.&#x201d; This was always a one-way game, since there&#x2019;s nothing mysterious about where Madeline gets her appearance. She looks exactly like her mom, only shorter.</p><p>&#x201c;We thought that girl from Ghana could be your twin!&#x201d; Madeline laughed, which made Mrs. Coleman appear again.</p><p>&#x201c;Mayim. Emunah.&#x201d; She said our Hebrew names like she was too tired to be stern, which made me feel worse than if she&#x2019;d just yelled at us.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>We looked back at our books, but now my mind was with the <i>Children of the World</i>. That book was about how everyone&#x2019;s the same on the inside, but I always liked it more for how different everyone looks on the outside. In my town, everyone looks pretty much the same, and it&#x2019;s not like me. Nobody in my own family even looks like me. My mom is tall and sturdy, like she&#x2019;s built to survive a Nordic winter. My dad is also tall, but angular and spindly, like he&#x2019;d have to spend that Nordic winter huddled close to the fireplace (probably stocked with wood my mom had chopped). They both have fair skin, thick brown hair, and icy blue eyes.</p><p>My brother Jaime&#x2019;s skin is a shade darker. His eyes are brown, and his hair is a shiny black. Not surprising, given that he&#x2019;s adopted from Guatemala.</p><p>Then there&#x2019;s me. I&#x2019;m short and skinny. My arms and legs look like toothpicks no matter how much tennis I play or how many bowls of tortellini I eat. (My records, by the way, are fifteen hours of tennis in one week and five bowls of tortellini in one sitting. I like tennis, but I&#x2019;m obsessed with tortellini.) My complexion&#x2019;s a little darker than Jaime&#x2019;s, but my light brown eyes are flecked with green. My hair is soft and springy, with tight coils that extend up and out, challenging gravity. Parker says I look &#x201c;exotic&#x201d;&#x2014;she&#x2019;s actually used that word, straight out of an ad for some honeymoon resort&#x2014;and she&#x2019;s always lamenting that she doesn&#x2019;t. She says I&#x2019;d get a ton of modeling jobs if I wanted them. Apparently, talent agents want people whose ethnicity &#x201c;keeps you guessing.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m no stranger to guessing. I know I was born in Philadelphia, and I know my birth mother was black. The rest has been left to my imagination, and boy, has my imagination embraced the challenge. Long after Madeline outgrew <i>Children of the World,</i> I kept playing on my own, holding up pages next to my reflection in the mirror. Picture by picture, I&#x2019;d compare the tone of my skin, the shape of my nose, lips, eyes. Is my father Irish or Italian? Am I a quarter Filipino? Part Indian or Latina or Arab? I never have an answer when people ask, &#x201c;What are you?&#x201d; I usually tell them I&#x2019;m human, but sometimes I also add that I&#x2019;m Jewish, just to make them more confused.</p><p>When Madeline and I were in third grade, and she said that Ghanaian girl looked like my twin, I started to wonder if I really might have a twin somewhere in the world. I imagined that my mother gave birth to twins, but she could only afford to keep one child, so she placed me for adoption. Unlikely, I know, and not the happiest story. But even if it were true&#x2014;that I was a twin and my birth mother kept my sister but not me&#x2014;I told myself I could handle it. I just wanted to know.</p><p>I still want to know.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why, for my bat mitzvah gift, I want to find my family. My <i>first</i> family. My blood-and-guts, double-helix, you&#x2019;re-as-stubborn-as-your-father family.</p><p>Does that sound reasonable?</p><p>My phone vibrated in my pocket, and I nearly jumped. I glanced around to make sure Mrs. Coleman was out of sight, then I took it out. A text from Madeline, who was still, like, twenty inches away. I rolled my eyes at her, but she was pretending to be very interested in Kristallnacht. (Like, too interested. She was pointing at something in the book and nodding and saying &#x201c;hmm.&#x201d;)</p><p>I opened her text. <i>Tell your parents tonight.</i></p><p>I sighed again. Maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked Madeline to make sure I do this. She wants to be an investigative reporter when she grows up&#x2014;like one of the people on NPR, this boring radio station her parents always have on in the car&#x2014;and I was starting to wonder if she was in this for me, or if she was just hoping for her first big story: <i>From NPR News in Baltimore, I&#x2019;m Madeline Winter with the latest on Imani&#x2019;s adoption story.</i></p><p>I guess I could tell her to back off, but I <i>do </i>want to investigate this too. More than anything. I just wish I could do it in a way that won&#x2019;t hurt my parents beyond repair.</p><p>Another vibration. Another text from the reporter-in-training. <i>Play the bat mitzvah card. Adult in Judaism, etc. etc.</i></p><p>This was a convincing point. When we turn thirteen and have our bat mitzvahs, we&#x2019;ll be considered adults in the Jewish religion. It doesn&#x2019;t get us much in the real world&#x2014;I won&#x2019;t be able to see R-rated movies or buy a scratch-off lotto ticket or anything&#x2014;but Mrs. Coleman and Rabbi Seider like to remind us that it does mean something symbolically. The symbolism seems extra applicable to me, since the odds that I&#x2019;m genetically Jewish are probably, like, zero. Madeline thinks I should milk that symbolism for all it&#x2019;s worth. I&#x2019;m the only black girl in Hebrew school, gamely researching a heritage that has no biological connection to me. The least my parents can do is let me research my real history too, right? If I&#x2019;m considered an adult in Judaism, I should be old enough to deal with whatever I discover.</p><p><i> Ok</i>, I texted back. <i>I will.</i> I was feeling strong and sure. I was really going to do it. That night.</p><p>I watched Madeline&#x2019;s eyes move down to the phone hidden in her book. Then she looked up at me and nodded, her freckled face lit up with satisfaction. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t run away and live with your biological family, wherever they are, okay?&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; I said. I held up Parker&#x2019;s invitation. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;d miss the event of the century.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline shook her head. I thought she might bring up Ethan, who I could see cleaning his glasses with the bottom of his T-shirt, but instead she said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe her braces are Photoshopped out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Parker always looks good in pictures,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;even without Photoshop. How come I always look like I&#x2019;m about to sneeze?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look great in pictures,&#x201d; Madeline insisted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the one who always has, like, one eye half blinking and the other looking at the wrong camera.&#x201d;</p><p>She made a face, trying to demonstrate, and I let out a laugh so loud, the entire class&#x2014;including Ethan&#x2014;looked our way. Mrs. Coleman did not look happy. Luckily, the bell rang at that exact moment, and Madeline and I bolted before we could get in trouble. We ran, laughing and puffing, out the side door of the temple and to the corner, where we had to wait for our younger brothers so we could all walk home together.</p><p>&#x201c;Let me know what your parents say,&#x201d; Madeline said, catching her breath.</p><p>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; I promised. &#x201c;Tonight.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Anatomicum</h2><p><i>Welcome to the museum that is always open to explore...</i><br><br>Step inside the pages of <i>Anatomicum</i> to enjoy the experience of a museum from the comfort of your own home.

Written in a clear, straightforward style, this book packs in a great deal of detail in a very small space.

On the way to rescuing them, the sisters meet their likable Uncle Jake, whom they had never heard of before. Granny Relda had arranged for everyone in town to forget him after he inadvertently broke the spell that kept a deranged Little Red Riding Hood in the asylum. The book is loaded with cameos by fairy-tale characters, including Prince Charming as playboy turned sleazy politician. Although they will delight fairy-tale fans, some of the most interesting figures get short shrift. Puck, who combines magic with mischief in a way that both attracts and repels Sabrina, disappears from the action early on. Granny Relda's gentleman friend and every tale's wicked wolf is resurrected only at the end of the novel. Still, there is plenty of plucky Sabrina, nurturing Granny Relda, and Daphne. The end leaves plenty for the next book to resolve. Each chapter starts with a menacing silhouette, and black-and-white full-page illustrations add more macabre details. Recommend this to anyone who is craving a bit of dark humor rolled up with whimsy and adventure.<i>&#x2013;Tina Zubak, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The City of Light, the City of Love and the City of Romance, familiar platitudes, but once you experience it for yourself you understand why. There is a je ne sais quoi allure to this city that beguiles, but never completely reveals what makes it so universally appealing. Artists, poets, writers, and composers have tried to define exactly what it is about this place, and yet they succeed only to a point. Perhaps it is as elusive as defining love, for to be in Paris entails experiencing love, about someone, something, some place. </p><p>There is so much to do - you know the big ones, <strong>the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, Sacre Coeur, St. Germain des Pres, the Left Bank, the Right Bank, the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs Elys�es, the Op�ra-</strong> but don't miss the fun of discovering the small ones, the ones off the beaten path. Nothing like taking your time strolling thru the turn of the century mansion that houses <strong>Mus�e Marmottan</strong> then enjoying a caf� and patisserie in the museums jewel box caf�. Wandering aimlessly is romantic. Getting lost isn't romantic. In fact there are few things that can drain the romance out of a situation faster than realizing that you're hopelessly lost. </p><p>So take your travel map and put it away if you want to wander, but have no fear that your wandering will turn into a lost odyssey. You can always pull out the STREETWISE� Paris Map and get yourself pointed back in the right direction. Paris is not without faults. Sometimes people can be rude, but that's the case anywhere in the world - be it a large city or small village. You get what you give. And in the case of Paris, as with any true love, you accept the flaws with the charms, the weaknesses with the strengths. In the end the true beauty of Paris will surpass any blemish. Life from a Parisian perspective is beautiful. But that's another clich�, isn't it? </p><p>The pocket size map of Paris is laminated for durability and accordion folding for effortless use.

Told in alternating teen voices across three generations, <i>You Bring the Distant Near </i>explores sisterhood, first loves, friendship, and the inheritance of culture--for better or worse. From a grandmother worried that her children are losing their Indian identity to a daughter wrapped up in a forbidden biracial love affair to a granddaughter social-activist fighting to preserve Bengali tigers, award-winning author Mitali Perkins weaves together the threads of a family growing into an American identity. Here is a sweeping story of five women at once intimately relatable and yet entirely new.</p><p>Dear reading friend,<br><br>I'm so delighted you're about to read <i>You Bring the Distant Near</i>, a novel based on my own life, or my "hyphenated life," as I sometimes call it. How did I acquire this weird label? It's mostly due to my parents and the choices they made during migration.Dad--technically a refugee from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)--became a harbor engineer, traveled far and wide, stood in the presence of Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and Queen Elizabeth, and settled his family in California when I was in the seventh grade.<br><br>He died just before <i>You Bring the Distant Near </i>was released, and I grieved hard, mourning the loss of his humor, loving company, and joyful spirit. I also miss his stories of Poshora, the village where seven generations of my family lived on a jute farm. Thanks to Dad's deep roots in that particular place, no matter how people saw us, we didn't identify ourselves as Asian-Americans, Indian-Americans, or even Bengali-Americans. I knew as a child that the Bosefamily was from Poshora in Faridpur, East Bengal.<br><br>The problem is that now, without Dad's witty, adept use of the Bangla language, recitations of Tagore's poetry, and reminiscences from childhood, it feels like the hyphen connecting my identities has taken a blow. Will it be fatal? My parents' shift from country to country--one that I didn't choose--has already cost me, like growing up far away from a supportive network of relatives and grandparents. Dad's life and stories provided that particular connection I have to that faraway village in East Bengal. With Dad gone, will I tilt even more to the American side? I don't like the thought of that.<br><br>Apart from the peoples who originated in this continent, we are a nation of hyphenated folk. As time passes and generations come and go, our connections to the villages of our origins become more tenuous. We forget languages spoken by our ancestors, we lose the stabilizing power of traditions when it comes to rites of passage like birth, marriage, death. Soon, we may come to identify primarily as Americans, a nationality that has nothing to do with race or culture. Is it all loss? Or are there gains, too?<br><br>This novel, <i>You Bring the Distant Near</i>, tests and refine the hyphen acquired by the fictional Das family. (It's based, of course, on the experiences of the Bose family immigrating here in the 1970s; I've described it as "memoir on steroids, with freedom to fabricate.") The novel is multi-generational and spans more than two decades. I wrote it in three parts, describing the changes in the family when they first arrive as <b>strangers</b>, try to balance the old and new as <b>travelers</b>, and eventually define themselves as <b>settlers</b> in this new world.<br><br>There are losses to becoming hyphenated, as I sought to show in this novel, but I hoped also to show the gains. Some village traditions rightfully should be discarded - like shadism, which values lighter skin over dark, and widows being thrown on the funeral pyre of their husbands as in olden-days Bengal. And leaning into your "American" identity brings you into proximity with people with hundreds of different identities, some of whom might even become friends, or even family members. Isn't that a gift? It has been for me.<br><br>In fact, these days, I hover close to my hyphen, adding and discarding identities to the right and left of it like a crazy lady. Back in the day, my newly-acquired hyphen sent me fleeing to the Queens Library and I became a devourer of story, learning how to imagine other lives. It's also one of the only things about me that will never change. The village culture where my Dad grew up is long gone, and "American culture" (oxymoronic, perhaps, in a nation of immigrants?) is constantly in flux.<br><br>My hope is that <i>You Bring the Distant Near </i>will inspire you to embrace the small em-dash between identities that connects us all as humans. Find your hyphen and stay close by. I'll meet you there. Peace be with you, and let me know what you think about the book.<b>Mitali Perkins </b>has written novels for young readers, including <i>Rickshaw Girl </i>(a NYPL Top 100 Book) and <i>Bamboo People</i> (an ALA Top 10 YA novel), and her newest novels, <i>You Bring the Distant Near </i>and <i>Forward Me Back To You</i>.

This approach works well because there's a lot going on here besides his narration: Jazzy music speeds up as the story's pace quickens, and light background noises represent the candy machine at work. At first, these machine noises puzzle the listening adult (it sounds as if the story was produced in a parking lot), but kids are unlikely to notice.

But after investigating over 60 cases of alien abduction through hundreds of hours of interviews and treatment, Dr. Mack now presents the mesmerizing tales of alien encounters revealed by his patients-- none of whom are mentally ill-- and the profound, surprising and at times deeply spiritual impact these experiences have has on their lives. Providing details of alien encounters never before reported or depicted on the screen, the men and women whose experiences are related here in unforgettably vivid detail are not extremists recounting dreams or hallucinations. Rather, as Dr. Mack reports, they are survivors of harrowing, real-life experiences that challenge the most basic assumptions that make up our understanding of our existence and our role in the universe.ENDIVE BESTSELLER--THE MOST RIVETING ACCOUNT EVER PUBLISHED ON ALIEN ABDUCTION<br>PULITZER PRIZE-WINNER<br>John E. Mack, M.D.<br>"Fascinating, suggestive, and even inspiring."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br>"A TRANSCENDENT, LANDMARK WORK...An extraordinarily rich and strange mind-expanding book.--Boston Herald<br>When respected Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack, M.D., first published these astonishing results of four years of intensive research and investigation into alien abduction, he unleashed a firestorm of controversy. Now, in this paperback edition, Mack answers his critics, both believers and skeptics. Mack focuses on thirteen ordinary Americans (from nearly one hundred case studies) who tell dramatic, inspiring, and remarkably similar stories: repeated visits from large-eyed beings, mysterious machines, telepathy, invasive medical procedures, hours missing from their lives, and startling messages about the future....<br>"Provocative...This book is</p><h2>Nicolae: The Rise of Antichrist (Left Behind Series Book 3) The Apocalyptic Christian Fiction Thriller and Suspense Series About the End Times</h2><p>It has been nearly two years since the day of the mass disappearances. In one cataclysmic instant, millions all over the globe simply vanished, leaving everything but flesh and bone behind. Global war has erupted, and the Tribulation Force sets a suicidal course that places them in direct opposition to the rise of Antichrist. A repackage of the third book in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Left Behind series.</p><p>Antichrist. The very word send shivers through us. And Nicolae Carpathia certainly does not disappoint as Antichrist. <i>Nicolae</i> is the third book in <i>Left Behind</i> series written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, and is preceded by book one, <i>Left Behind</i>, and book two, <i>Tribulation Force</i>.<p> Nicolae Carpathia becomes the focus as he continues to consolidate his power, unifying political states ("Global Community"), media ("Global Community Network," "Global Weekly"), and religions ("Enigma Babylon One World Faith") under a Nicolae-appointed supreme pontiff. Nicolae himself is grand potentate of the global community.</p><p> Our heroes, pilot Rayford Steele and journalist Buck Williams, along with the rest of the Tribulation Force, continue their struggle to survive and protect their families in the midst of global war and destruction. They have come to recognize Nicolae Carpathia to be the Antichrist prophesied in the Bible, and to them it comes as no great revelation that this man, who presented himself as a charming and benevolent leader, has been unmasked as a ruthless and cruel tyrant, manipulating people and events to serve his own ends. And his ends are undoubtedly evil.</p><p> It becomes apparent that the chaos and turmoil created by Nicolae are the fulfillment of John's prophesy of the seven seals as recorded in the book of Revelation. And it becomes also apparent they are now facing the sixth seal, a great earthquake which is sometimes called "the wrath of the lamb." This upheaval of the earth, with its accompanying death and destruction, is familiar apocalyptic imagery: a blood-red moon, a sun turned black, and the stars falling from the sky. And the Tribulation Force discovers that these incredible descriptions turn out to be not so very far from the truth.</p><p> Who survives? How? What does Nicolae have in mind for the world? Readers of the first two books should not be disappointed with this third installment to this chilling tale.</p>Global Community forces shatter U.S. cities. Carpathia promises peace, urges global unity. Military vows to eliminate insurgent &#x2018;Tribulation Force&#x2019;. <br><br>In the two years since millions vanished in an instant, a new world order has risen from the rubble. Tension crackles as the strangely enthralling leader Nicolae Carpathia consolidates his power over the new Global Community. Heads of state, financial and religious leaders, and even the media cower before Carpathia, reduced to puppets of his regime. Only pilot Rayford Steele, journalist Buck Williams, and the rest of the Tribulation Force know Carpathia for what he truly is&#x2015;a dictator intent on snaring the world in his web of deceit. Amid personal heartbreak and the bloodshed and chaos of World War III, the Tribulation Force must stop him at any cost. <br><br>Evil has a name: <i>Nicolae</i>&#x2015;#3 in the phenomenal <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Left Behind series that rocked the publishing world and made millions think seriously about the future and their places in it. <br><br>With special features relating to current events and end-times prophecy.</p><h2>IV Starts for the RN and EMT: RAPID and EASY Guide to Mastering Intravenous Catheterization, Cannulation and Venipuncture Sticks for Nurses and Paramedics from the Fundamentals to Advanced Care Skills</h2><p><b> <p><b>From the Basics to Advanced techniques</b></p> <p><b> 3rd Edition for 2016 is New and Greatly Expanded with over 120 pages of text, graphics and illustrations to help you start IVs!</b></p> </b> <p>Intravenous cannulation is one of the most difficult skills most RNs, LVNs and EMTs will learn.

You will now need to thread the rest of the catheter into the vein. The catheter is fully inside the vein when only the hub sticks out. There are several different methods to advancing the catheter</p> <br><br> <b>The Two Handed Technique</b> <ol> <li>You have already visualized flash, lowered your angle, advanced 1-2mm and released the tourniquet.</li> <li>Continue holding the needle in place</li> <li>With your non-dominant hand, grasp the hub of the catheter and slide it forward into the vein</li> <li>Slowly withdraw the needle</li> <li>Place your thumb on the hub of the catheter to hold it in place</li> <li>Use your index finger to press down above the site to prevent blood from spilling out</li> </ol> <br> <b>The Single Handed Technique</b> <br> <ol> <li>You have already visualized flash, lowered your angle, advanced 1-2mm and released the tourniquet.</li> <li>Continue holding the needle in place.</li> <li>Use the index finger of the hand that is holding the needle to slide the catheter past the needle</li> <li>Continue sliding the catheter until it is fully inside the vein.</li> </ol> With the above two techniques, be careful that you are only advancing the catheter into the vein and not the needle. If the catheter is inside the vein it should be relatively easy and painless to advance it. Unlike the needle, the catheter is soft and flexible so it will be difficult to slide it in unless you are inside the vein. <ul> <li>If the flashback was very small, you may feel resistance...</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Dogs of Christmas</h2><p><p><b>A delightful Christmas gift from W.

An expert in the science of food, Dr. Fuhrman speaks directly to readers who want to take control of their health and avoid taking medication or undergoing complicated, expensive surgery, the two standard treatments prescribed today.</p><p>Following the model of his previous programs that have successfully tackled conditions from diabetes to dieting, Dr. Fuhrman&#x2019;s plan begins with the food we eat. He focuses on a high nutrient per calorie ratio, with a range of options for different needs and conditions. He shows us what to remove and what to add to our diets for optimum heart health, provides menu plans and recipes for heart-healthy meals and snacks, and includes helpful questions for doctors and patients.</p><p>By understanding heart disease and its triggers, Dr. Fuhrman gives us the knowledge to counter-attack this widespread epidemic and lead longer, healthier lives.</p></p><p><p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States today&#x2014;but it isn&#x2019;t inevitable. </p><p>In fact, at least ninety percent of heart disease&#x2013;related deaths are entirely preventable. The cure for America&#x2019;s most lethal killer doesn&#x2019;t require expensive, confusing, and life-altering medications or rounds of invasive and ultimately ineffective surgery. The truth is heart disease can be reversed; it is not a natural consequence of aging; nor does it have to take away from your quality of life. </p><p>In <em>The End of Heart Disease</em>, Joel Fuhrman, M.D., a board-certified physician and #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Eat to Live</em> and <em>The End of Dieting</em>, shows how you can prevent and reverse heart disease and its related symptoms with his revolutionary&#x2014;both safe and proven&#x2014;Nutritarian plan.</p><p>Grounded in the latest scientific research and Dr. Fuhrman&#x2019;s twenty-five years of clinical experience treating heart disease, the program radically lowers cholesterol and blood pressure, reduces your weight, heals obstructive coronary artery disease, and can even eradicate advanced heart disease&#x2014;all without the need for dangerous procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery. In addition, you&#x2019;ll enjoy a complete meal plan filled with a variety of delicious food options. </p><p>Eat better. End heart disease.

She started her teaching career in the 1980s as a primary school teacher in rural Australia. She then moved to Melbourne and taught at a number of inner-city schools. In 1985, Jay had a change of career and became an educational editor and publisher. In the early 90s, Jay and her partner moved to Japan to work as English teachers. They lived and worked in Japan for over three and a half years. In fact, Jay&#39;s first daughter was born there. On returning to Australia, Jay began work as an educational author/packager. Since that time, she has authored and produced numerous award-winning titles for the educational publishing industry. Jay is also an accomplished children&#39;s book author, writing a number of titles for such literacy series as ZigZags, Totally Kidz, Deadly and Incredible, and a children&#39;s picture book series for Penguin. She is currently working with an educational publisher as lead author of a literacy series. Jay has written over 100 titles in that series. Jay is a mother of three daughters and was a school councillor at her local school for over seven years. This time spent in schools both as a teacher and a parent inspired her to ask the question of her community: &#39;What are we doing in schools to protect our children from unsafe touch?&#39; When she realised very little was actually being done, she decided to use her authoring and publishing skills to write Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept to help parents, carers and teachers to broach the subject of self-protection and to encourage children to speak up. After the encouraging response to Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept, she realised there was a need to further build upon the idea of children not keeping secrets about unsafe touch. Jay participated in Protective Behaviours professional development and attended numerous conferences on the topic to educate herself in how to keep children safe and provide them with prevention education. Jay then went on to develop and publish a comprehensive Body Safety and Respectful Relationship Teacher&#39;s Resource Kit as well as writing several more children&#39;s books on the topics of Body Safety, consent, respect, body boundaries and gender equality. Jay&#39;s ongoing passion for the safety and empowerment of children continues today with new manuscripts and free-to-download Body Safety resources always in the wings.</p><h2>Berenstain Bears: 5-Minute Berenstain Bears Stories</h2><p><p><strong>Each of these twelve classic Berenstain Bears tales is the perfect length to fill five minutes of storytelling and features the full-color illustrations that children love.</strong></p><p><strong>This collection features a padded cover and is a treasure to be read again and again at bedtime, storytime, or anytime!</strong></p><p>The Berenstain Bears are a busy family.

Crichton said of his decision to pursue writing full time: "To quit medicine to become a writer struck most people like quitting the Supreme Court to become a bail bondsman." <br><br> <b>1972:</b> Crichton's second novel under his own name <i>The Terminal Man</i>, is published. Also, two of Crichton's previous works under his pen names, <i>Dealing</i> and <i>A Case of Need</i> are made into movies. After watching the filming, Crichton decides to try his hand at directing. He will eventually direct seven films including the 1973 science-fiction hit <i>Westworld</i>, which was the first film ever to use computer-generated effects. <br><br> <b>1980:</b> Crichton draws on his anthropology background and fascination with new technology to create <i>Congo</i>, a best-selling novel about a search for industrial diamonds and a new race of gorillas. The novel, patterned after the adventure writings of H. Ryder Haggard, updates the genre with the inclusion of high-tech gadgets that, although may seem quaint 20 years later, serve to set Crichton's work apart and he begins to cement his reputation as "the father of the techno-thriller." <br><br> <b>1990:</b> After the 1980s, which saw the publication of the underwater adventure <i>Sphere</i> (1987) and an invitation to become a visiting writer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1988), Crichton begins the new decade with a bang via the publication of his most popular novel, <i>Jurassic Park</i>. The book is a powerful example of Crichton's use of science and technology as the bedrock for his work. Heady discussion of genetic engineering, chaos theory, and paleontology run throughout the tightly-wound thriller that strands a crew of scientists on an island populated by cloned dinosaurs run amok. The novel inspires the 1993 Steven Spielberg film, and together book and film will re-ignite the world&#x2019;s fascination with dinosaurs.<br><br> <b>1995:</b> Crichton resurrects an idea from his medical school days to create the Emmy-Award Winning television series <i>ER</i>. In this year, <i>ER</i> won eight Emmys and Crichton received an award from the Producers Guild of America in the category of outstanding multi-episodic series. Set in an insanely busy an often dangerous Chicago emergency room, the fast-paced drama is defined by Crichton's now trademark use of technical expertise and insider jargon. The year also saw the publication of <i>The Lost World</i> returning readers to the dinosaur-infested island. <br><br> <b>2000:</b> In recognition for Crichton's contribution in popularizing paleontology, a dinosaur discovered in southern China is named after him. "Crichton's ankylosaur" is a small, armored plant-eating dinosaur that dates to the early Jurassic Period, about 180 million years ago. "For a person like me, this is much better than an Academy Award," Crichton said of the honor.<br><br> <b>2004:</b> Crichton&#x2019;s newest thriller <i>State of Fear</i> is published. <br><br> <br><b>Amazon.com's Significant Seven</b><br> <i>Michael Crichton kindly agreed to take the life quiz we like to give to all our authors: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.</i><br><br></p><p> <b>Q:</b> What book has had the most significant impact on your life?<br> <b>A:</b> <i>Prisoners of Childhood</i> by Alice Miller <br><br> <b>Q:</b> You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD--what are they?<br> <b>A:</b> <i>Tao Te Ching</i> by Lao Tzu (Witter Bynner version) <br> <i>Symphony #2 in D Major</i> by Johannes Brahms (Georg Solti) <br> <i>Ikiru</i> by Akira Kurosawa <br><br> <b>Q:</b> What is the worst lie you've ever told?<br> <b>A:</b> Surely you're joking.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Describe the perfect writing environment.<br> <b>A:</b> Small room.

In the little white house, Mrs. Bear was putting Sam to bed.<br><br>Outside, the wind blows and the rain comes down. Inside, it is Sam's bedtime. Mrs. Bear reads him a story, tucks him in, and brings him warm milk. "Are you ready now, Sam?" she asks. "I'm waiting," he says. What else does Sam need before he'll go to sleep? Could Mrs. Bear have forgotten a kiss? This&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling story by two of the most beloved picture book creators is available in a board book edition suitable for the youngest listeners.</p><p>Every child has his or her own personal repertoire of rationalizations for avoiding bed, and every parent has a stockpile of counter offensives.

Could there be <i>anything</i> Mama Bear is forgetting?

His numerous children's books include <i> Mr. Wellington</i> and<i> Cold Feet</i>, winner of the 2002 Boston Globe-Horn Book Award.</p>This American Library Association Sibert Honor book details the creation of a Jackson Pollack painting. Pollack's studied and careful process incorporates his world experiences--from the big sky and Native American sand painting of his Western boyhood to the beat of his favorite jazz musicians. From the moment the canvas is placed on the floor until the last flick of his unconventional medium, house paint, Jackson moves and dances around his work. Ed Harris's straightforward and unobtrusive narration provides ample opportunity for the listener to appreciate the artist at work. Some painting moments are studied and reflective; others are a frenzy of activity. Harris's tone and pacing mirror each. Gentle jazz provides just the right background.

From the days when gentlefolk ascended the heights in hoop skirts and wool suits to today's high-tech assaults on wintry summits, this book offers extensive and intimate profiles of people who found trouble on New Hampshire's Presidential Range, from the nineteenth century through present day. Veteran journalist Nicholas Howe draws on his investigative skills and familiarity with the mountains of his childhood to create this gripping collection. The result is a compelling story about our changing relationship with the mountains we love and the risks they pose. This Tenth Anniversary Edition includes a new afterword by Nicholas Howe, with commentary on how our relationship with the Presidential Range has evolved over the last decade. </p></p><p>Like a piece of granite chipped off a Presidential peak, veteran journalist Nicholas Howe's assessment of misadventure in New Hampshire's rugged mountains has a crisp, puritanical feel that fairly rasps New England. Take his description of the near-vertical (and now well-skied) slope that nearly killed Max Engelhart in 1926: "Tuckerman Ravine is a sort of twin to Huntington Ravine, a left-hand punch into the side of Mount Washington by the same primordial giant that made Huntington with his right." Underlying <i>Not Without Peril</i> is the not-so-subtle message that the Presidential Range, topping out at just over 6,000 feet, is as uncompromising as any other mountain range. After all, these mountains--named for Washington, Lincoln, Madison--are home to some of the most vicious weather recorded on the planet. Howe makes no judgment about those whose misfortunes he chronicles; there are tender moments that manage to stay faithful to a crusty Yankee sensibility, as in the tale of Lizzie Bourne, who died in a snowstorm while huddled in a makeshift lean-to. Howe quotes her uncle George: "She was dead--had uttered no complaint, expressed no regret or fear, but passed silently away." Such sober tales, scrupulously researched, tell the history of a mountain range and its climbers, some of whom are immortalized for their ill-fated treks. It's a gritty read, a touch morbid, but more than compensated for by sharp writing and compelling drama. <i>--Tipton Blish</i>The Presidential Range of New Hampshire is like few places in the world. Located only 150 miles north of a major city, the range is home to beautiful alpine gardens, stunning vistas, and a carefully maintained network of hiking trails. But these same mountains can offer some of the world's worst weather. While the valleys below are bathed in warm sunshine, the exposed summits may be lashed by hurricane-force winds, blinding snows, and numbing cold. Into this potentially deadly environment come hikers, skiers, and climbers by the thousands, drawn by the beauty, accessibility, and history of the mountains. It is a recipe for challenge, adventure - and tragedy. Not Without Peril offers extensive and intimate profiles of twenty-two climbers who found trouble on the Presidential Range from 1849 to 1994. Summer snowstorms, raging rivers, impenetrable fog banks, and a single misplaced step are all part of the dangers awaiting even the most careful hiker. Veteran journalist Nicholas Howe sifted through crumbling archives, interviewed dozens of participants, and hiked the mountains to retrace each fateful journey. The result is a compelling story of our changing relationship with the mountains we love and the risks they pose.

He was the first black man, and the first &#x201c;skinny kid with big ears and a funny name,&#x201d; as he put it, to become president of the United States. Being the first anything is never easy, as Obama would learn during his two terms in office. But he was prepared for it. After spending his boyhood in Indonesia, he knew a little something about being the new kid in town.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The moment he walked through the front gate of his new home, little Barry Obama knew one thing for sure: he wasn&#x2019;t in Honolulu anymore.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For starters, a huge hairy animal was ready to hop onto his shoulders. The creature was high in the treetops of Barry&#x2019;s new front yard, perched on a branch and howling at him. Amazed, Barry turned to his mother, who was equally surprised.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;His name is Tata,&#x201d; explained Barry&#x2019;s stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, who owned the house and the swinging simian guest.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stepping into the ape&#x2019;s enormous shadow, Lolo paused to feed it a peanut from his pocket. Then he turned to his stepson. &#x201c;I brought him all the way from New Guinea for you!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Barry knew that his stepfather had a job drawing maps for the Indonesian army, and that his work took him to some strange and faraway places. But he had no idea that Lolo had returned from one of his trips with such an unusual welcome-home gift.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Barry leaned forward to examine the ape. Tata, however, was not in a welcoming mood. He looked like he was about to lunge forward, so Barry backed away.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; Lolo reassured him. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s on a leash.&#x201d; He gave Tata another peanut and then gestured for Barry and his mother to follow him into the backyard. &#x201c;Come,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This new place was a big change for Barry. Back in Hawaii, he had lived with his grandparents in a four-bedroom home in one of Honolulu&#x2019;s prettiest neighborhoods.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His new house, on the volcanic island of Java, was in a ramshackle neighborhood on the outskirts of town. Half the people in the capital of Jakarta lived in old bamboo huts. Electricity had come to the residents only a couple years earlier.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get to his new house, Barry had to cross a narrow rickety bridge over a wide brown river. Below he could see children riding water buffalo and villagers washing their clothes in the muddy water.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Barry felt like he had traveled to an exotic and distant land. Things went from strange to stranger when he followed Lolo into the backyard.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the looks of the place, you might have thought Lolo was a zookeeper. Animals emerged to greet them from all corners: chickens and ducks, a snake, an iguana, even a turtle the size of a cookie tin. A large yellow dog howled. A big white cockatoo screeched. Two brilliantly colored birds shook their long tail feathers. Barry would soon learn they were called birds of paradise and could be found all over New Guinea. Lolo explained that his travels allowed him to pursue an unusual hobby: collecting unusual animals.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The strangest creature of all resided in a concrete tub, about a foot and a half deep and a yard long that was half submerged in a small pond fenced off by chicken wire. Green and scaly, it looked like a cross between a dragon and a crocodile. The Indonesians knew it as a biawak, or monitor lizard, a venomous meat eater that liked to feast on crabs, squid, and fish. As Barry peered into the tub, he made a frightening discovery. There wasn&#x2019;t just one lizard. There were two!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the only foreign child in the neighborhood, Barry was teased more than any other kid. His&nbsp;appearance also made him stand out. He was chubby, with dark skin and curly hair. At school, he was known as &#x201c;the Little Duck&#x201d; because of the way he waddled when he ran.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&#x2019;t help that Barry couldn&#x2019;t speak the Indonesian language. For the first few months, he spent most of his time sitting by himself in the back of the classroom, drawing Superman and Batman in his notebook. But after just six months, he had learned the language and could communicate with the other children. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes the other kids would play pranks on Barry. They&#x2019;d offer him something he was familiar with from America, like chocolate. But when he bit into it, he found that it was shrimp paste. Another time they gave him red hot cayenne peppers and told him it was candy.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day Barry tagged along with a group of his school friends on a visit to the local swamp. When they arrived, some of the other boys seized him by his hands and feet. They picked him up and began to swing him back and forth. &#x201c;One...two...three!&#x201d; they yelled, and threw him into the water.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What they didn&#x2019;t know was that Barry had learned how to swim in Hawaii. Paddling furiously, he managed to escape the murky waters by himself.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Barry never felt totally comfortable living in Indonesia. It would always remain a somewhat scary place where he didn&#x2019;t quite fit in. But he learned to adapt, finding ways to make it feel more like home. Learning to speak the local language was one way. Standing up for himself when teased was another. Barry joined the scouts, taught himself to sing local patriotic songs, and even studied karate.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He also stopped hiding in the back of the class and moved up front, where he became well known among his teachers for always shouting out the right answers.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whenever he encountered an aspect of Indonesian culture that puzzled or surprised him, Barry would write a letter to his grandparents back in Hawaii. He would tell them about the people he met or the unusual foods he ate&#x2014;like roasted grasshoppers and crispy fried crickets. In return, they would send him packages of familiar treats from America, like peanut butter and chocolate. But not every detail made it into his letters. Some things he saw, like the extreme poverty and disease that afflicted many villagers, were just too difficult for him to put into words.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After four years in Jakarta, Barry was no longer the new kid in town. He had learned to survive new surroundings. But he was still homesick. His mother, Ann Dunham, realized that he would be happier back in Hawaii. She also worried about his future growing up in such a poor and turbulent country. So when Barry was ten, Ann and Lolo put him on a plane to Honolulu and sent him to live with his grandparents. It was just the next stop on a long journey that would take Barack Obama on to Los Angeles and New York, then from Boston to Chicago, and eventually all the way to the White House.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes you have to leave a place before you really begin to appreciate it. In later years, Barack Obama would remember his time in Indonesia as &#x201c;one long adventure, the bounty of a young boy&#x2019;s life.&#x201d; He always cherished the memories of his childhood, even when he became president of the United States.</p><h2>Spanish Essentials For Dummies</h2><p>Learning a new language is a fun and challenging feat for students at every level.

Its brilliance made the ice that coated the city, and the Benedictine Abbey where we'd just had our showdown with a fallen immortal and a rogue High Priestess, shimmer so that everything around me seemed touched by our Goddess. I looked at the moonlight-bathed circle that stood in front of Mary's Grotto, the place of power where not long ago Spirit, Blood, Earth, Humanity, and Night had been personified and then had joined to triumph over hatred and darkness. The carved image of Mary, surrounded by stone roses and nestled within a ledge high in the grotto, appeared to be a beacon for the silver light. I stared at the statue. Mary's expression was serene; her ice-covered cheeks glistened as if she wept in quiet joy.</p><p>My gaze lifted to the sky. <i>Thank you.</i> I sent a silent prayer up to the beautiful crescent that symbolized my Goddess, Nyx. <i>We're alive. Kalona and Neferet are gone.</i></p><p>"Thank you," I whispered to the moon.</p><p><i>Listen within .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>The words swept through me, subtle and sweet like leaves touched by a summer breeze, brushing my consciousness so lightly that my waking mind barely registered them, yet Nyx's whispered command imprinted itself into my soul.</p><p>I was vaguely aware that there were a lot of people (well, nuns, fledglings, and a few vampyres) around me. I could hear the mixture of shouting, talking, crying, and even laughing that filled the night, but it all felt distant. At that moment the only things that were real to me were the moon above and the scar that sliced from one shoulder all the way across my chest to the other shoulder. It tingled in response to my silent prayer, but it wasn't a tingle of pain. Not really. It was a familiar warm, prickling sensation that assured me Nyx had, once again, Marked me as hers. I knew if I peeked under the neck of my shirt I would find a new tattoo decorating that long, angry-looking scar with an exotic filigree of sapphire--a sign that proved I was following my Goddess's path.</p><p>"Erik and Heath, find Stevie Rae, Johnny B, and Dallas--then check the perimeter of the abbey to be certain all the Raven Mockers fled with Kalona and Neferet!" Darius shouted the command, snapping me out of my warm, fuzzy prayer mode, and once I'd been shocked out, it was like an iPod had been cranked too high as sound and confusion flooded my senses.</p><p>"But Heath's a human. A Raven Mocker could kill him in a second." The words burst from my mouth before I could clamp it shut, proving beyond all doubt that being moonstruck wasn't my only moronic skill.</p><p>Predictably, Heath puffed up like a cat-smacked toad.</p><p>"Zo, I'm not a damn pussy!"</p><p>Erik, looking very tall and full-grown, kick-your-butt vampyre-like, snorted sarcastically and then said, "No, you're a damn human. Wait, that <i>does</i> make you a pussy!"</p><p>"So, we defeat the big baddies and inside five minutes Erik and Heath are banging their chests at each other. How totally predictable," Aphrodite said with her patented sarcastic sneer as she joined Darius, but her expression completely changed when she turned her attention to the Son of Erebus Warrior. "Hey there, Hotness. You doing okay?"</p><p>"You need not worry about me," Darius said. His eyes met hers, and they practically telegraphed the chemistry between them, but instead of going to her like he usually would and doing some very gross kissing, he remained focused on Stark.</p><p>Aphrodite's gaze went from Darius to Stark. "Okay, eew. Your chest is totally crispy crittered."</p><p>James Stark was standing between Darius and Erik. Okay, well, <i>standing</i> wasn't exactly what he was doing. Stark was swaying and looking extremely unsteady.</p><p>Ignoring Aphrodite, Erik spoke up. "Darius, you should probably get Stark inside. I'll coordinate the reconnoitering with Stevie Rae and make sure everything runs smoothly out here." His words seemed okay, but his tone was all I'm-the-big-guy-in-charge, and when he followed up with a condescending "I'll even let Heath help out," he really sounded like a pompous butt.</p><p>"You'll <i>let me</i> help out?" Heath snapped. "Your <i>mom</i> will let me help out."</p><p>"Hey, which one of them is supposed to be your boyfriend?" Stark asked me. Even in the terrible shape he was in, he caught my glance with his. His voice was scratchy, and he sounded scarily weak, but his eyes sparkled with humor.</p><p>"I am!" Heath and Erik said together.</p><p>"Oh, for crap's sake, Zoey, they're both idiots!" Aphrodite said.</p><p>Stark started to chuckle, which turned to a cough, which changed again to a painful gasp. His eyes rolled back and, like a slinky, he collapsed.</p><p>Moving with the quickness that came naturally to a Son of Erebus Warrior, Darius caught Stark before he hit the ground. "I need to get him inside," Darius said.</p><p>I felt like my head was going to explode. Sagging in Darius's arms, Stark looked well on his way to being dead. "I-I don't even know where the infirmary is," I stuttered.</p><p>"Not a problem. I'll get a penguin to show us," Aphrodite said. "Hey, you, nun!" she yelled at one of the nearby black-and-white-clad sisters who had scurried out of the abbey after the night had gone from battle chaos to aftermath chaos.</p><p>Darius hurried after the nun, with Aphrodite following him. The warrior glanced over his shoulder at me. "Aren't you coming with us, Zoey?"</p><p>"As soon as I can." Before I could deal with Erik and Heath, from behind me a familiar twang saved the day.</p><p>"Go on with Darius and Aphrodite, Z. I'll take care of Dumb and Dumber and be sure there's no booger monsters left out here."</p><p>"Stevie Rae, you are the Best Friend of All Best Friends." I turned and hugged her quickly, loving how reassuringly solid and normal she felt. Actually, she seemed so normal that I got a weird twinge when she stepped back and grinned at me and I saw, as if for the first time, the scarlet tattoos that spread out from the filled-in crescent in the middle of her forehead and down either side of her face. A sliver of unease threaded through me.</p><p>Misunderstanding my hesitation, she said, "Don't worry about these two dorks. I'm gettin' used to jerking them apart." When I just stood there staring at her, the bright smile she'd been wearing dimmed. "Hey, you know your grandma's okay, right? Kramisha got her back inside right after Kalona was banished and Sister Mary Angela just told me she was goin' inside to check on her."</p><p>"Yeah, I remember Kramisha helping her into the wheelchair. I'm just .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." My voice trailed off. I was just what? How could I put into words that I was haunted by a feeling that everything wasn't right with my best friend and the group of kids she'd allied herself with, and how do I say that <i>to</i> my best friend?</p><p>"You're just tired and worried 'bout a bunch of stuff," Stevie Rae said softly.</p><p><i>Was that understanding I saw flicker through her eyes? Or was it something else, something darker?</i></p><p>"I get it, Z, and I'll take care of things out here. You just be sure Stark's okay." She hugged me again, and then gave me a little push in the direction of the abbey.</p><p>"'Kay. Thanks," I said lamely, starting toward the abbey and totally ignoring the two dorks who were standing there staring at me.</p><p>Stevie Rae called after me, "Hey, remind Darius or someone to keep an eye on the time. It's only about an hour until sunrise, and you know me and all the red fledglings gotta be inside out of the sun by then."</p><p>"Yeah, no problem. I'll remember," I said.</p><p>The problem was it was getting harder and harder for me to <i>forget</i> Stevie Rae wasn't what she used to be.</p><p>TEMPTED Copyright � 2009 by P. C.

But when Toot leaves Woodcock Pocket to travel and see the world, Puddle chooses to stay at home. Just when Puddle begins to miss his old friend, he embarks on some of his own adventures-right at home. Finally, after Toot returns from his year-long trip, the two discover that true friendship knows no boundaries.<br><br>With a delightful mix of humor, warmth, and a classic style all her own, Holly Hobbie captures the all excitement and joy that surround adventures-near and far-and reminds readers that true friendship knows no boundaries.</p><p>Holly Hobbie has worked as an artist for more than thirty years. She is the creator of many books, including the New York Times bestselling picture book series, <em>Toot &amp; Puddle</em>, an illustrated memoir entitled <em>The Art of Holly Hobbie, </em>and most recently, <em>Fanny</em>. Holly lives with her husband in Conway, Massachusetts.The activities of a homebody and an enthusiastic world traveler are contrasted in illustrations brimming with humor. Two anthropomorphic pigs live in the country setting of Woodcock Pocket. There, Puddle turns his head to the sun streaming in his kitchen window as he makes popcorn on the stove. Meanwhile, Toot peers at the globe with a magnifying glass, planning an ambitious trip. He asks Puddle along, but goes forth alone, and from then on, the experiences of the two are laid side by side on the double-page spreads. A monthly postcard from Toot is reproduced over an illustration from his year-long adventure (scaling cliffs in the Alps, visiting an Italian pastry shop, taking a camel ride through Egypt, etc.), and a sort of reply comes from a scene of Puddle savoring events on the home front: gathering maple sap for syrup, playing in spring mud, painting a self-portrait, or trying out a Halloween mask. In Hobbie's expert watercolors are dozens of inventive touches--Puddle wearing a shower cap in the bath, Toot floating among hippos, some of his limbs breaking the surface in a subtle mimicry of their stances, funny allusions to famous art or locales; the book and its heroes are endearing, and readers will want to see more of Woodcock Pocket soon.

After finishing his studies at the Art Student League and the New York School of Industrial Design, Mr. Galdone worked in the art department of a major publishing house. There he was introduced to the process of bookmaking, an activity that was soon to become his lifelong career. Before his death in 1986, Mr. Galdone illustrated almost three hundred books, many of which he himself wrote or retold. He is fondly remembered for his contemporary style, bright earthy humor, and action-filled illustrations, which will continue to delight for generations to come.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1 Galdone lends new life and sense to the verse in this exuberant retelling of the Mother Goose rhyme with four delightful feline characters. The large type is readable and inviting, with only one or two lines of text per page. Double-page spreads are filled with vibrant watercolor washes over ink sketches. While the expressions of the cats will be the focus of children's attention, there are countless details for them to discover for themselves, such as the animal-influenced decor of the cats' home, the spice cabinet filled with different varieties of catnip, and cat ancestor portraits. Children will relate to the kittens' deserved punishment for carelessness, their theatrical displays of sorrow, and their earnest efforts to get into both their mother's good graces and that delicious looking pie. This refreshingly hearty version of the nonsense verse will be as much a favorite of adult storytellers as it will be of toddler listeners. Yvonne A.

Stir in the return of Calder's friend Tommy (which creates a tense triangle), H.G. Wells's The Invisible Man, 3-D pentominoes, and the hunt for a coded message left behind by Wright, and the kids become tangled in a dangerous web in which life and art intermingle with death, deception, and surprise.<br><br></p><p>Blue Balliett is the author of several bestselling, acclaimed mystery novels, including Chasing Vermeer (a Book Sense Book of the Year and an Edgar Award winner), The Wright 3, The Calder Game, and The Danger Box. She writes in the laundry room of her home in Chicago, Illinois, and you can find her online at www.blueballiettbooks.com.<br><br>Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, and grew up in Orem, Utah. He entered Brigham Young University as an engineering major, but soon realized this was not the right choice for him. Having decided to take time off from college, he headed to Taiwan where he stumbled into a job illustrating English textbooks, which he enjoyed. There, a friend introduced him to an illustration student, also from Brigham Young University. This introduction inspired Brett to eventually switch majors. After spending a year in Taiwan, he went back to BYU and transferred to the illustration department. In 1993 he received a fine arts degree in illustration.<br><br>What is art? Balliett's newest book asks listeners to ponder that question and whether Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House is art. While Petra, Calder, and Tommy work to answer that question and to save the house from destruction, they slowly build a friendship, and a team. Ellen Reilly's reading is solid; her narrator is clear and builds the pace from the startling beginning through the mysterious happenings. Her character voices are distinct; although her male voices tend to sound forced, her female voices sound real. An occasional change in the production's balance doesn't distract but does break the flow of the narrative.

Don't you have enough already?"<br><br>Or perhaps, even though you're very successful, you hear that voice warning:<br><br>"Watch out. Don't get pushy. . . ."<br><br>This voice probably talks the loudest when you're thinking about asking for something you want&#x2014;a raise, a better title, more power or responsibility, or even more help around the house. And the odds are, you listen to this voice. You may think it's the voice of experience, or maybe your common sense preventing you from doing something rash. Or perhaps you think you should be grateful for what you've got&#x2014;you should feel lucky&#x2014;and not screw things up by reaching for more.<br><br>We've written this book to help you talk back to that voice. Because that voice is not the voice of experience and it's not your common sense. It's not even your voice. It's the voice of a society that hasn't progressed nearly as far as we'd like to think, a society that's still trying to tell women how they should and shouldn't behave. It's a voice whose message is conveyed, often unwittingly, by our parents, teachers, colleagues, and friends&#x2014;and then repeated and amplified by the media and popular culture.<br><br>If you have that voice in your head, whoever's voice it is, that voice is holding you back. It's slowing you down, it's damaging your self-esteem, and it's costing you money. By telling you not to ask for the things you want, that voice is cutting you off from dozens&#x2014;maybe hundreds&#x2014;of opportunities to improve your life and increase your happiness. It's also preventing you from learning how to negotiate for what you need with skill and confidence. It's preventing you from discovering the ways in which negotiating effectively can be an extraordinary tool for transforming your life.<br><i><br><br>Women don't ask<br></i><br>We know that this is true&#x2014;that women don't ask for what they want and need, and suffer severe consequences as a result&#x2014;because we've spent years studying the phenomenon. In the mid-1990s, Linda was serving as the director of the Ph.D. program at the Heinz School, the graduate school of public policy and management at Carnegie Mellon University, where she teaches. One day a group of female graduate students came to her office. "Why are most of the male students in the program teaching their own courses this fall," the women asked, "while all the female graduate students have been assigned to act as teaching assistants to regular faculty?" Not knowing the answer, Linda took the students' question to the associate dean in charge of making teaching assignments, who happened to be her husband. His reply was straightforward. "I'll try to find teaching opportunities for any student who approaches me with a good idea for a course, the ability to teach, and a reasonable offer about what it will cost," he said. "More men ask. The women just don't ask."<br><br>Could he be right? Linda recalled other situations in which a female student had protested because a male student had enjoyed some form of special treatment. One woman told Linda that she assumed she couldn't march in June graduation ceremonies the year she completed her dissertation because she wasn't scheduled to get her degree until August. She asked why Linda had allowed two men to march who also didn't finish until the end of the summer. Another woman asked why Linda had found funding for a male student to attend an important public policy conference and hadn't provided the same opportunity to her. A third woman observed a male student using department facilities to print up business stationery for himself and said she thought it was unfair that other students weren't allowed to do the same. In each case, the men had asked, and Linda, who saw it as a central part of her job to help students in any way she could, happily obliged.<br><br>Linda realized with chagrin that she'd been perpetuating discrimination&#x2014;the last thing she wanted to do&#x2014;simply by not noticing how much more often men asked for things that would help them get ahead. And the discrimination she'd perpetuated could have far-reaching consequences. Men with teaching experience would have meatier resumes and appear better qualified when they entered the job market than women who did not. The man who attended the public policy conference made valuable contacts that could be useful later in his career, and the woman who couldn't afford to go had missed out. The man who printed up his own stationery was able to present himself as a more polished and professional job candidate than the women who had not.<br><br>The social scientist in Linda perked up. She'd spent ten years teaching negotiation to students, salespeople, business executives, scientists, physicians, lawyers, and women's leadership groups. Did this difference in the rate of asking between her male and female students indicate that women weren't using negotiation to promote their careers as much as they could be? Was this a problem that contributed to the unequal treatment of women throughout their adult lives?<br><br>Linda turned to the existing research about gender differences in negotiation to find out. What she discovered surprised her: This large body of research looked almost exclusively at how men and women behave when they're negotiating. No one had taken a step back to look at what motivates people to negotiate in the first place, and&#x2014;more significantly&#x2014;whether men and women use negotiation to advance their goals at the same rate.<br><br>Eager to learn more, Linda and several colleagues launched a research program to explore these questions. She and her collaborators invited men and women into their research lab, asked them to play carefully designed games, and observed whether they used negotiation to improve their positions. They sent graduate students armed with questionnaires to airports and shopping malls. They designed experiments that explored the emotions people associate with negotiation. They created a huge Web survey to poll people of every age and economic group, from the lowest-skilled to the highest-paid professionals, about their attitudes toward negotiation. This survey asked participants about how and when they used negotiation and about the types of situations in which they felt they could negotiate. The bottom line: In every study, Linda's team found clear and consistent evidence that men initiate negotiations to advance their own interests about four times as frequently as women do.<br><br><i><br>The cost of not asking<br></i><br>Does this difference matter? Does the relative infrequency with which women assert what they want actually cost women, and if so, what are the costs? Since the wage differential between men and women still hovers around 77 percent&#x2014;meaning women on average earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man&#x2014;Linda decided to look first at salaries. What she found shocked her: Not negotiating their salaries, it turns out, can be outrageously expensive for women. Here are a few examples of how costly it can be.<br><br>At twenty-two, just out of college, you and a twenty-two-year-old man with the same qualifications are offered the same job for the same salary: $25,000. You accept the $25,000 while the man negotiates and raises his starting salary to $30,000. The man deposits the extra $5,000 in a low-earning account, an account that grows about 3 percent every year. Throughout your working lives, the two of you both average 3 percent annual salary increases but of course your salary can't keep pace with his because he started out higher. Every year, the man takes the difference between what he would have earned if he'd accepted the $25,000 (what you're earning) and what he's actually earning because he negotiated for more, and he adds that amount to the same low-yield account he opened when he was twenty-two. By the time he's ready to retire at sixty-five, that account contains $784,192&#x2014;over three-quarters of a million dollars accumulated simply because he negotiated that one time. That's over three-quarters of a million dollars you don't have because you didn't negotiate. If the man puts the money in an account earning 5 or 6 percent, his gains would be even higher.<br><br>At thirty, having just completed your MBA, you and a male peer receive job offers for $100,000. You take the $100,000&#x2014;that's a lot of money, after all&#x2014;but the man negotiates and gets his offer raised to $115,000. You both average 3 percent raises every year; he invests his extra money in an account earning 3 percent, and by the time you both reach sixty-five he's saved $1,519,486 (over $1.5 million) more than you have.<br><br>You're forty, you're not in a high-flying profession, and you've already reached the middle of your career. You know you've been chronically underpaid by market standards but you assume it's too late to do anything about it. You and a male colleague in the same position both launch a job search. You each receive offers for $70,000 a year, which you know is at the low end of the range for someone with your training and experience. Nevertheless, you accept the $70,000 your male colleague negotiates to correct this imbalance and gets the offer raised to $77,000. Every year until he retires, he invests the extra amount in a low-yield account and accumulates $381,067 more by the time you both reach sixty-five&#x2014;a nice addition to his retirement nest egg.<br><br>Those sums are high enough in themselves. When you add in other forms of compensation that are often tied to salary, such as bonuses, stock options, severance packages, and pension benefits (all of which women are also less likely to negotiate), the financial losses a woman can suffer from not negotiating become truly staggering.<br><br>But what if, like many of us, you don't measure your happiness by the size of your paycheck? Even so, financial costs this steep can make it hard to do many of the other things that matter to you more, such as owning a safe and comfortable home, educating your children, taking care of your family, and giving back to your community. The problem extends beyond the financial realm, in any case. Think about all the things you might negotiate besides your salary. Linda's research group also found that women frequently don't ask to be promoted before a promotion has been offered, don't request project assignments that match their skills and interests, and don't propose taking on more responsibility as soon as they feel ready. Women don't ask if they can work with people from whom they can learn and don't request additional training that could move them ahead faster. Women don't ask to be recognized for their hard work, ideas, and contributions, and this costs them dearly as well. Just as small income differences can rapidly turn into huge disparities, small differences in how one's work is evaluated can start a process that snowballs throughout one's working life. The result is no surprise: Women earn less money, progress more slowly in their careers, and don't rise as high as similarly talented men.<br><br><i><br>Spreading the word</i><br><br>Convinced that these findings were too important to be confined to academic journals, Linda decided to write a book to help women understand and combat this force holding them back. She knew she needed a partner in this endeavor, however, and one who shared her passion for helping women achieve greater fulfillment in their lives. After a little searching, she found Sara.<br><br>Sara had spent much of her career exploring the barriers women face, especially in male-dominated professions, as they pursue life and career paths that differ dramatically from those of their mothers&#x2014;and in many cases from those they'd originally planned to follow. She'd written extensively about women in literature and the arts, women in academia, and women in business&#x2014;about their struggles and their remarkable accomplishments too.<br><br>Once the two of us joined forces, Sara set off traveling around the country, interviewing women about their experiences with negotiation. She talked to women from every walk of life; women of every age and race; women with different political views and religious beliefs; women with high school diplomas, vocational training experience, and advanced degrees from the most elite colleges in the nation. She talked to women who work full-time, women who work part-time, and women who devote all their time to caring for their children or elderly relatives. She heard story after story about women hesitating to negotiate on their own behalf and suffering the consequences.<br><br>Using these stories to help explain and illustrate Linda's data, the two of us wrote our first book, Women Don't Ask. In it, we looked closely at the causes of this difference in negotiation behavior between men and women, and showed the far-reaching impact of the phenomenon&#x2014;on women, their families, their employers or employees, and society as a whole. We also established that it's not just older women who hesitate to negotiate for themselves. Many of the younger women Sara interviewed, especially the more successful ones, denied that they had any trouble asking for what they want. They negotiate for themselves just as much as their male colleagues do, they claimed. Unfortunately, Linda's data revealed this to be untrue. Despite advances made by women over the last few decades, the gap in the frequency with which younger men and women negotiate is about the same as the gap between older men and women. That young women don't know this puts them at an even greater disadvantage.<br><br>We found that the problem has a profound impact on the lives of women outside the workplace too. Married women who work full-time still perform two-thirds of the housework and child care at home. They enjoy far less leisure time than their male partners, and&#x2014;unlike men with families&#x2014;experience a dramatic upward spike in their stress levels at the end of the workday as they approach their "second shift." Constant stress of this sort can produce sustained elevated levels of stress hormones in one's blood, a significant risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, and depression, some of the major diseases that afflict women.<br><br><i><br>Changing women's lives</i><br><br>Women Don't Ask created something of a sensation, with reviews of the book and discussions of our ideas appearing in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Time, Fortune, the Economist, BusinessWeek, and the Harvard Business Review, as well as USA Today, Glamour, Self, Cosmopolitan, the Times (London), the International Herald Tribune, and French Cosmo. The two of us were interviewed about the book on local, national, and international radio and television shows, and U.S. Representatives John Dingell and Carolyn Maloney invited us to give a congressional briefing about our findings and their impact on the glass ceiling.<br><br>As thrilled as we were by this response, we enjoyed even more the hundreds of letters and e-mail messages we received from women telling us about the book's positive influence on their lives. Here are a few of the stories we heard:</p><h2>The Art of the Cheese Plate: Pairings, Recipes, Style, Attitude</h2><p>This book succeeds by matching some of the world's greatest cheeses with unexpected, seasonally inspired flavors and textures and presents a composed cheese plate as a fun, modern, and accessible option for delicious entertaining.&nbsp;Master delicious, sophisticated entertaining with acclaimed chef-fromager Tia Keenan&#x2019;s foolproof pairings and quick recipes for elegant cheese plates and inspired accompaniments. &nbsp;A perfect gift for any host or cheese lover, <i>The Art of the Cheese Plate</i> offers clear directions and expert tips for perfect cheese plates and creative condiments.

This classic book is one of the first given to newly bereaved parents to offer guidance in decision-making after their baby's death and to assist caregivers as they support families. Empty Arms encourages families to meet their babies and say hello before rushing to say goodbye. With compassion that comes from Sherokee and David's experience of having lived through the death of their son Brennan, the book offers guidance and practical suggestions for the decision-making at the time (including why and how one might see, hold, and memorialize one's baby) and over time (such as how to handle such times as anniversaries, holidays and the birth of other babies in the parents' close circle.)</p><p> Family and friends can learn how to understand the loss and be supportive of the bereaved families.</p><p> It offers ongoing support about subjects such as returning to work or to life, couple grieving, surviving children, feeling guilty, having another child or not, and feeling lonely.</p><p> With over 300,000 in print, this book touches the hearts of families at the time of their loss and over time as they heal. </p><p> An excellent bibliography and resource section are included.</p></p><p>Sherokee Ilse has had many personal experiences with loss which motivated her to reach out to others to aid them in their grief work. She has suffered a miscarriage, full term stillbirth, and an ectopic pregnancy and has two living children. Sherokee helped create a national non-profit organization which she directed for ten years, authored many books including her most popular one, Empty Arms (over 300,000 in print) and has served as a bereavement support professional, a consultant, and international trainer for over 27 years.<p> A guest on Oprah, Donohue and many other radio and television shows, she continues her mission to promote compassion, understanding, and excellent care for these special families.</p>I wish the hospital had given me Empty Arms to read immediately; instead I finally found it and opened it a month later. If someone had read it to me right then, especially the section 'Decisions You Might Face Right Away,' my regrets would have been so much less. Sherokee's gentle words and advice could have guided us to make better decisions after Bryce died and would have informed us of options that we didn't even know about.

She lives in Falmouth, Cornwall.</p><p></p><p></p>Anholt's cumbersome and text-laden story centers on the early years of Mary Anning, born in 1799 and known in her native England for her discovery of ancient fossils. From the moment that her beloved father, nicknamed "Pepper" for his "speckled beard," extracts a "snakestone" (a fossil of a snake) from the clay cliffs near their seaside home, Mary spends her days searching alone for similar "curiosities," while peers taunt her with the titular nickname. Soon after her father dies, Mary discovers a dog (with a coat like "speckled pepper") near his grave. Encouraged by the Philpot sisters, local scientists, the mournful girl continues to collect fossils and searches for the giant sea monster's bones, which, legend has it, lay hidden in the cliffs. Her devoted pet leads his young mistress to the skeleton of this ichthyosaur, then vanishes. As with the death of Mary's father, the text glosses over the dog's disappearance, but readers will likely see it as a shadow cast over the discovery and marking another significant loss in young Mary's life. Moxley's (Skip Across the Ocean) vividly hued, primitivist artwork features some creatively skewed perspectives as well as several potentially disturbing images: a farmhouse teeters on the edge of eroding cliffs, while nearby are half-submerged cows and a person apparently gesturing in distress. Anholt convincingly lays the groundwork for Anning to go on to become a noted scientist and local hero, but youngsters will likely find this account of her childhood sad rather than celebratory.

A battalion of South Vietnamese paratroopers made a stand reminiscent of the Spartans at Thermopylae in 480 BC. The heroic ARVN troops fought with a single American advisor&#x2014;Major John J. Duffy, who directed critical American air support and the breakout. Thousands of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops invaded the South with overwhelming ground combat strength, supported by long-range artillery and tanks. They were part of a force ordered to conquer the South by cutting it in half. In the Central Highlands, the 11th Airborne Battalion was flown to a mountain pass designated &#x201c;Charlie&#x201d; and ordered to block the large NVA force at all costs. Two weeks of vicious close-range fighting ended with both sides suffering horrific casualties. The greatly outnumbered ARVN paratroopers fought until 90% of their comrades were dead or disabled. The enemy death toll exceeded 1,000 and caused a two-week delay in the invasion timetable. This setback in their strategy caused the overall invasion to fail and forced an NVA withdrawal. Victory was won at great cost. Only 37 of the 471 paratroopers escaped the encirclement. Major Duffy was wounded several times while controlling critical air support throughout the battle. Because he had the only ground-air radio, he was targeted by the NVA as he planned and led a daring escape through enemy lines and ambushes. Under fire at the jungle landing zone, he was the last man to board the rescue chopper after assisting and confirming all troops were safely aboard. Major Duffy received the Distinguished Service Cross for valor and for saving the lives of the survivors. The story is told with poems, eyewitness accounts, and transcripts of a tape-recording by eyewitness (evacuation helicopter co-pilot).</p><p>John J. Duffy, the poet, has published five poetry books and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in poetry. Warman, Peaceman, and Sageman document his war experience as a Special Forces Commander. The Bush Chronicles gives a rendition of the most important events in George W. Bush&#x2019;s first term as President. Chromosome 23, a story about mankind, was nomination for a Pulitzer Prize. John served as a Commander in Special Operations and is a highly decorated officer. He rose from Sergeant to Major and has received more than sixty awards and decorations, including the Distinguished Service Cross and eight Purple Hearts. After military service, John held senior positions in Publishing and Finance. He founded an investment firm which was sold to Ameritrade. He is retired in Santa Cruz, California and writes poetry.

Then, slowly, it comes to me that unconscious people don&#x2019;t have a sensation of movement through the dark, accompanied by a faint, rhythmic sound that can only be a squeaky wheel. And I can feel contact, from the top of my head to the balls of my heels. I can smell something that might be rubber or vinyl. This is not unconsciousness, and there is something too . . . too what? Too rational about these sensations for it to be a dream.<br> <br>Then what is it?<br> <br>Who am I?<br> <br>And what&#x2019;s happening to me?<br> <br>The squeaky wheel quits its stupid rhythm and I stop moving. There is a crackle around me from the rubber-smelling stuff.<br> <br>A voice: &#x201c;Which one did they say?&#x201d;<br> <br>A pause.<br> <br>Second voice: &#x201c;Four, I think. Yeah, four.&#x201d;<br> <br>We start to move again, but more slowly. I can hear the faint scuff of feet now, probably in soft-soled shoes, maybe sneakers. The owners of the voices are the owners of the shoes. They stop me again. There&#x2019;s a thump followed by a faint whoosh. It is, I think, the sound of a door with a pneumatic hinge being opened.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s going on here? I yell, but the yell is only in my head. My lips don&#x2019;t move. I can feel them&#x2014;and my tongue, lying on the floor of my mouth like a stunned mole&#x2014;but I can&#x2019;t move them.<br> <br>The thing I&#x2019;m on starts rolling again. A moving bed? Yes. A gurney, in other words. I&#x2019;ve had some experience with them, a long time ago, in Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s shitty little Asian adventure. It comes to me that I&#x2019;m in a hospital, that something bad has happened to me, something like the explosion that almost neutered me twenty-three years before, and that I&#x2019;m going to be operated on. There are a lot of answers in that idea, sensible ones, for the most part, but I don&#x2019;t hurt anywhere. Except for the minor matter of being scared out of my wits, I feel fine. And if these are orderlies wheeling me into an operating room, why can&#x2019;t I see? Why can&#x2019;t I talk?<br> <br>A third voice: &#x201c;Over here, boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>My rolling bed is pushed in a new direction, and the question drumming in my head is What kind of a mess have I gotten myself into?<br> <br>Doesn&#x2019;t that depend on who you are? I ask myself, but that&#x2019;s one thing, at least, I find I do know. I&#x2019;m Howard Cottrell. I&#x2019;m a stock broker known to some of my colleagues as Howard the Conqueror.<br> <br>Second voice (from just above my head): &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking very pretty today, doc.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fourth voice (female, and cool): &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always nice to be validated by you, Rusty. Could you hurry up a little? The babysitter expects me back by seven. She&#x2019;s committed to dinner with her parents.&#x201d;<br> <br>Back by seven, back by seven. It&#x2019;s still the afternoon, maybe, or early evening, but black in here, black as your hat, black as a wood-chuck&#x2019;s asshole, black as midnight in Persia, and what&#x2019;s going on? Where have I been? What have I been doing? Why haven&#x2019;t I been manning the phones?<br> <br>Because it&#x2019;s Saturday, a voice from far down murmurs. You were . . . were . . .<br> <br>A sound: WHOCK! A sound I love. A sound I more or less live for. The sound of . . . what? The head of a golf-club, of course. Hitting a ball off the tee. I stand, watching it fly off into the blue . . .<br> <br>I&#x2019;m grabbed, shoulders and calves, and lifted. It startles me terribly, and I try to scream. No sound comes out . . . or perhaps one does, a tiny squeak, much tinier than the one produced by the wheel below me. Probably not even that. Probably it&#x2019;s just my imagination.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m swung through the air in an envelope of blackness&#x2014;Hey, don&#x2019;t drop me, I&#x2019;ve got a bad back! I try to say, and again there&#x2019;s no movement of the lips or teeth; my tongue goes on lying on the floor of my mouth, the mole maybe not just stunned but dead, and now I have a terrible thought, one which spikes fright a degree closer to panic: what if they put me down the wrong way and my tongue slides backward and blocks my windpipe? I won&#x2019;t be able to breathe! That&#x2019;s what people mean when they say someone &#x201c;swallowed his tongue,&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t it?<br> <br>Second voice (Rusty): &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll like this one, doc, he looks like Michael Bolton.&#x201d;<br> <br>Female doc: &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Third voice&#x2014;sounds like a young man, not much more than a teenager: &#x201c;He&#x2019;s this white lounge-singer who wants to be black. I don&#x2019;t think this is him.&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s laughter at that, the female voice joining in (a little doubtfully), and as I am set down on what feels like a padded table, Rusty starts some new crack&#x2014;he&#x2019;s got a whole standup routine, it seems. I lose this bit of hilarity in a burst of sudden horror. I won&#x2019;t be able to breathe if my tongue blocks my windpipe, that&#x2019;s the thought which has just gone through my mind, but what if I&#x2019;m not breathing now?<br> <br>What if I&#x2019;m dead? What if this is what death is like?<br> <br>It fits. It fits everything with a horrid prophylactic snugness. The dark. The rubbery smell. Nowadays I am Howard the Conqueror, stock broker extraordinaire, terror of Derry Municipal Country Club, frequent habitu� of what is known at golf courses all over the world as The Nineteenth Hole, but in &#x2019;71 I was part of a Medical Assistance Team in the Mekong Delta, a scared kid who sometimes woke up wet-eyed from dreams of the family dog, and all at once I know this feel, this smell.<br> <br>Dear God, I&#x2019;m in a bodybag.<br> <br>First voice: &#x201c;Want to sign this, doc? Remember to bear down hard&#x2014;it&#x2019;s three copies.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sound of a pen, scraping away on paper. I imagine the owner of the first voice holding out a clipboard to the woman doctor.<br> <br>Oh dear Jesus let me not be dead! I try to scream, and nothing comes out.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m breathing though . . . aren&#x2019;t I? I mean, I can&#x2019;t feel myself doing it, but my lungs seem okay, they&#x2019;re not throbbing or yelling for air the way they do when you&#x2019;ve swum too far underwater, so I must be okay, right?<br> <br>Except if you&#x2019;re dead, the deep voice murmurs, they wouldn&#x2019;t be crying out for air, would they? No&#x2014;because dead lungs don&#x2019;t need to breathe. Dead lungs can just kind of . . . take it easy.<br> <br>Rusty: &#x201c;What are you doing next Saturday night, doc?&#x201d;<br> <br>But if I&#x2019;m dead, how can I feel? How can I smell the bag I&#x2019;m in? How can I hear these voices, the doc now saying that next Saturday night she&#x2019;s going to be shampooing her dog which is named Rusty, what a coincidence, and all of them laughing? If I&#x2019;m dead, why aren&#x2019;t I either gone or in the white light they&#x2019;re always talking about on Oprah?<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a harsh ripping sound and all at once I am in white light; it is blinding, like the sun breaking through a scrim of clouds on a winter day. I try to squint my eyes shut against it, but nothing happens. My eyelids are like blinds on broken rollers.<br> <br>A face bends over me, blocking off part of the glare, which comes not from some dazzling astral plane but from a bank of overhead fluorescents. The face belongs to a young, conventionally handsome man of about twenty-five; he looks like one of those beach beefcakes on Baywatch or Melrose Place. Marginally smarter, though. He&#x2019;s got a lot of dark black hair under a carelessly worn surgical-greens cap. He&#x2019;s wearing the tunic, too. His eyes are cobalt blue, the sort of eyes girls reputedly die for. There are dusty arcs of freckles high up on his cheekbones.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, gosh,&#x201d; he says. It&#x2019;s the third voice. &#x201c;This guy does look like Michael Bolton! A little long in the old tootharoo; maybe . . .&#x201d; He leans closer. One of the flat tie-ribbons at the neck of his greens tunic tickles against my forehead. &#x201c;. . . but yeah. I see it. Hey, Michael, sing something.&#x201d;<br> <br>Help me! is what I&#x2019;m trying to sing, but I can only look up into his dark blue eyes with my frozen dead man&#x2019;s stare; I can only wonder if I am a dead man, if this is how it happens, if this is what everyone goes through after the pump quits. If I&#x2019;m still alive, how come he hasn&#x2019;t seen my pupils contract when the light hit them? But I know the answer to that . . . or I think I do. They didn&#x2019;t contract. That&#x2019;s why the glare from the fluorescents is so painful.<br> <br>The tie, tickling across my forehead like a feather.<br> <br>Help me! I scream up at the Baywatch beefcake, who is probably an intern or maybe just a med-school brat. Help me, please!<br> <br>My lips don&#x2019;t even quiver.<br> <br>The face moves back, the tie stops tickling, and all that white light streams through my helpless-to-look-away eyes and into my brain. It&#x2019;s a hellish feeling, a kind of rape. I&#x2019;ll go blind if I have to stare into it for long, I think, and blindness will be a relief.<br> <br>WHOCK! The sound of the driver hitting the ball, but a little flat this time, and the feeling in the hands is bad. The ball&#x2019;s up . . . but veering . . . veering off . . . veering toward . . .<br> <br>Shit.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m in the rough.<br> <br>Now another face bends into my field of vision. A white tunic instead of a green one below it, a great untidy mop of orange hair above it. Distress-sale IQ is my first impression. It can only be Rusty. He&#x2019;s wearing a big dumb grin that I think of as a high-school grin, the grin of a kid who should have a tattoo reading BORN TO SNAP BRA-STRAPS on one wasted bicep.<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael!&#x201d; Rusty exclaims. &#x201c;Jeez, ya lookin gooood! This&#x2019;z an honor! Sing for us, big boy! Sing your dead ass off!&#x201d;<br> <br>From somewhere behind me comes the doc&#x2019;s voice, cool, no longer even pretending to be amused by these antics. &#x201c;Quit it, Rusty.&#x201d; Then, in a slightly new direction: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the story, Mike?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mike&#x2019;s voice is the first voice&#x2014;Rusty&#x2019;s partner. He sounds slightly embarrassed to be working with a guy who wants to be Andrew Dice Clay when he grows up. &#x201c;Found him on the fourteenth hole at Derry Muni. Off the course, actually, in the rough. If he hadn&#x2019;t just played through the foursome behind him, and if they hadn&#x2019;t seen one of his legs stickin out of the puckerbrush, he&#x2019;d be an ant-farm by now.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hear that sound in my head again&#x2014;WHOCK!&#x2014;only this time it is followed by another, far less pleasant sound: the rustle of underbrush as I sweep it with the head of my driver. It would have to be fourteen, where there is reputedly poison ivy. Poison ivy and . . .<br> <br>Rusty is still peering down at me, stupid and avid. It&#x2019;s not death that interests him; it&#x2019;s my resemblance to Michael Bolton. Oh yes, I know about it, have not been above using it with certain female clients. Otherwise, it gets old in a hurry. And in these circumstances . . . God.<br> <br>&#x201c;Attending physician?&#x201d; the lady doc asks. &#x201c;Was it Kazalian?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Mike says, and for just a moment he looks down at me. Older than Rusty by at least ten years. Black hair with flecks of gray in it. Spectacles. How come none of these people can see that I am not dead? &#x201c;There was a doc in the foursome that found him, actually. That&#x2019;s his signature on page one . . . see?&#x201d;<br> <br>Riffle of paper, then: &#x201c;Christ, Jennings. I know him. He gave Noah his physical after the ark grounded on Mount Ararat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rusty doesn&#x2019;t look as if he gets the joke, but he brays laughter into my face anyway. I can smell onions on his breath, a little leftover lunchstink, and if I can smell onions, I must be breathing. I must be, right? If only&#x2014;<br> <br>Before I can finish this thought, Rusty leans even closer and I feel a blast of hope. He&#x2019;s seen something! He&#x2019;s seen something and means to give me mouth-to-mouth. God bless you, Rusty! God bless you and your onion breath!<br> <br>But the stupid grin doesn&#x2019;t change, and instead of putting his mouth on mine, his hand slips around my jaw. Now he&#x2019;s grasping one side with his thumb and the other side with his fingers.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive!&#x201d; Rusty cries. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive, and he&#x2019;s gonna sing for the Room Four Michael Bolton Fan Club!&#x201d;<br> <br>His fingers pinch tighter&#x2014;it hurts in a distant coming-out-of the Novocain way&#x2014;and begin to move my jaw up and down, clicking my teeth together. &#x201c;If she&#x2019;s ba-aaad, he can&#x2019;t see it,&#x201d; Rusty sings in a hideous, atonal voice that would probably make Percy Sledge&#x2019;s head explode. &#x201c;She can do no rrr-ongggg . . .&#x201d; My teeth open and close at the rough urging of his hand; my tongue rises and falls like a dead dog riding the surface of an uneasy waterbed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop it!&#x201d; the lady doc snaps at him. She sounds genuinely shocked. Rusty, perhaps sensing this, does not stop but goes gleefully on. His fingers are pinching into my cheeks now. My frozen eyes stare blindly upward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Turn his back on his best friend if she put him d&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Then she&#x2019;s there, a woman in a green-gown with her cap tied around her throat and hanging down her back like the Cisco Kid&#x2019;s sombrero, short brown hair swept back from her brow, good-looking but severe&#x2014;more handsome than pretty. She grabs Rusty with one short-nailed hand and pulls him back from me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Rusty says, indignant. &#x201c;Get your hands off me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you keep your hands off him,&#x201d; she says, and there is no mistaking the anger in her voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of your Sophomore Class wit, Rusty, and the next time you start in, I&#x2019;m going to report you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, let&#x2019;s all calm down,&#x201d; says the Baywatch hunk&#x2014;doc&#x2019;s assistant. He sounds alarmed, as if he expects Rusty and his boss to start duking it out right here. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just put a lid on it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s she bein such a bitch to me?&#x201d; Rusty says. He&#x2019;s still trying to sound indignant, but he&#x2019;s actually whining now. Then, in a slightly different direction: &#x201c;Why you being such a bitch? You on your period, is that it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Doc, sounding disgusted: &#x201c;Get him out of here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mike: &#x201c;Come on, Rusty. Let&#x2019;s go sign the log.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rusty: &#x201c;Yeah. And get some fresh air.&#x201d;<br> <br>Me, listening to all this like it was on the radio.<br> <br>Their feet, squeaking toward the door. Rusty now all huffy and offended, asking her why she doesn&#x2019;t just wear a mood-ring or something so people will know. Soft shoes squeaking on tile, and suddenly that sound is replaced by the sound of my driver, beating the bush for my goddam ball, where is it, it didn&#x2019;t go too far in, I&#x2019;m sure of it, so where is it, Jesus, I hate fourteen, supposedly there&#x2019;s poison ivy, and with all this underbrush, there could easily be&#x2014;<br> <br>And then something bit me, didn&#x2019;t it? Yes, I&#x2019;m almost sure it did. On the left calf, just above the top of my white athletic sock. A redhot darning needle of pain, perfectly concentrated at first, then spreading . . .<br> <br>. . . then darkness. Until the gurney, zipped up snug inside a bodybag and listening to Mike (&#x201c;Which one did they say?&#x201d;) and Rusty (&#x201c;Four, I think. Yeah, four&#x201d;).<br> <br>I want to think it was some kind of snake, but maybe that&#x2019;s only because I was thinking about them while I hunted for my ball. It could have been an insect, I only recall the single line of pain, and after all, what does it matter? What matters here is that I&#x2019;m alive and they don&#x2019;t know it. It&#x2019;s incredible, but they don&#x2019;t know it. Of course I had bad luck&#x2014;I know Dr. Jennings, remember speaking to him as I played through his foursome on the eleventh hole. A nice enough guy, but vague, an antique. The antique had pronounced me dead. Then Rusty, with his dopey green eyes and his detention-hall grin, had pronounced me dead. The lady doc, Ms. Cisco Kid, hadn&#x2019;t even looked at me yet, not really. When she did, maybe&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate that jerk,&#x201d; she says when the door is closed. Now it&#x2019;s just the three of us, only of course Ms. Cisco Kid thinks it&#x2019;s just the two of them. &#x201c;Why do I always get the jerks, Peter?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Mr. Melrose Place says, &#x201c;but Rusty&#x2019;s a special case, even in the annals ...</p><h2>The World Encyclopedia of Stamps &amp; Stamp Collecting: The Ultimate Illustrated Reference To Over 3000 Of The World'S Best Stamps, And A Professional ...

In a deadly barrage of 67 shots, 4 students were killed and 9 shot and wounded. It was the day America turned guns on its own children&#x2014;a shocking event burned into our national memory. A few days prior, 10-year-old Derf Backderf saw those same Guardsmen patrolling his nearby hometown, sent in by the governor to crush a trucker strike. Using the journalism skills he employed on <i>My Friend Dahmer</i> and <i>Trashed</i>, Backderf has conducted extensive interviews and research to explore the lives of these four young people and the events of those four days in May, when the country seemed on the brink of tearing apart. <i>Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio</i>, which will be published in time for the 50th anniversary of the tragedy, is a moving and troubling story about the bitter price of dissent&#x2014;as relevant today as it was in 1970.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Derf Backderf</b> is the bestselling, award-winning author of <i>My Friend Dahmer</i> and <i>Trashed</i>.

When the last echoes faded from the chamber, she turned to the space ranger standing before her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Greetings, Comrade Barx,&#x201d; Muffee said. &#x201c;My fellow Alpha Dogs and I have summoned you here for a matter of the utmost importance. It concerns recently intercepted communications from the planet Earth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Earth!&#x201d; Barx exclaimed. &#x201c;Do you mean the wonderful planet that is home to the gentle and generous beings known as Humans?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The very one,&#x201d; Muffee said. &#x201c;As you know, thousands of years ago, this distant paradise was spoiled when our mortal enemies&#x2014;<i>cats</i>&#x2014;began using Earth as a maximum security prison.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her ears instinctively went back, as did those of the assembled.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As you also know, we sent our finest peacekeeping officers to protect the Humans from the feline menace. But when cats stopped exiling their criminals to Earth, our contact with the planet ceased,&#x201d; Muffee said. &#x201c;What you <i>don&#x2019;t</i> know is that our enemies have resumed this despicable practice.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Barx began to growl, but Muffee held up a paw.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is even worse than you think. The cat they have sent to Earth is the greatest criminal in the known universe: Wyss-Kuzz the Wicked! Or, as he has become known in his exile, <b>KLAWDE</b>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Comrade Fydo bared her yellow teeth. &#x201c;No dog will ever forget what he did to us!

It will help you get in touch with your primal self.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You may even enjoy such primitive freedoms,&#x201d; Muffee said. &#x201c;But no matter how sorely you are tempted, do not become bonded to any of the Humans,&#x201d; she warned. &#x201c;Otherwise, you will be subject to the Master Clause! And if that happens, comrade, your mission may fail.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Barx was down to his collar and license, but still he stood proud. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I will find this Wyss-Kuzz, and I will make him repay his debt to dogkind!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The entire Security Pack howled their approval.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Raj, I need your help!&#x201d; My dad poked his head into my room, wearing his plaque is wack T-shirt. &#x201c;Do you think I should sign up for the <i>King of Crowns</i> lecture, or the <i>Pearly Gates: Adventures in Tooth Whitening</i> demonstration?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a Sunday afternoon, and he and Mom were about to leave for a dental conference&#x2014;in <i>Hawaii</i>.

Suddenly he yelped and snatched his arm away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Klawde&#x2019;s paw was poking out from underneath a pair of shorts.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Awww</i>, look at the little stowaway!&#x201d; Dad said, rubbing his scratched hand. &#x201c;You want to come to Hawaii, buddy?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Klawde hissed.<br> &nbsp;<br> I heard a car pull up, and then the doorbell rang.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That must be your ajji,&#x201d; Mom said to me. &#x201c;Go let her in!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I ran downstairs and opened the door to find my grandma standing on the porch. In one hand, she was holding the handle of the world&#x2019;s biggest rolling suitcase. In the other, she was holding a leash. <br> Which was attached to a <i>dog</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br><b><br>Chapter 2</b><br> &nbsp;<br> It was a gloriously sunny afternoon, and I was at nap. My sleep was not the death-like slumber of the Humans, but the hyper-aware trance in which all felines plot their schemes. And, oh, what schemes I had! A trio of brilliant inventions, each designed to help me reconquer my home planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> The only question was which device to launch first. The Zom-Beam, a laser that would turn Humans into my brainwashed soldiers? The<i> </i>Starsucker, a giant battery that harnessed the destructive power of supernovas? Or the Squirr-a-pult, which I think explains itself? All three were under development by my minion, Flooffee-Fyr, in a secret lab far beneath the surface of Lyttyrboks.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to his engineering work, Flooffee kept me informed about the political situation back home. Happily, my nemesis, General Ffangg, was in prison. But the traitorous calico&#x2014;the Earth kitten <i>I myself</i> had rescued from a life of stupidity and sloth&#x2014;now reigned with exceptional cruelty from the Most High Throne, and all cats despised her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course I was proud of my prot�g�. But more importantly, her low popularity gave me the opportunity to overthrow her oppressive regime. And replace it with one of my own!<br> &nbsp;<br> I rolled over inside my scheming chamber&#x2014;a device the ogres called a &#x201c;suitcase.&#x201d; Suddenly, the bald ogre began tossing his garish bodily coverings upon me. The gall!<br> &nbsp;<br> After slashing him with my claws, I was settling back to nap when the intruder alert rang.<br> &nbsp;<br> The boy-Human hurried to open the front portal, and that was when I heard the barbaric sound that disturbs the feline soul like no other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Could it be?<br> &nbsp;<br> Creeping downstairs, I saw to my horror an ancient, unfamiliar ogre holding the shackles of one of <i>them.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The mortal enemy of all felines.<br> &nbsp;<br> A <b>DOG</b>.<br> &nbsp;<br> My whiskers twitched in revulsion. I had never in my life been this<i> </i>close to a canine, Lyttyrboks being separated from the dog planets by a billion-mile-wide neutral zone. (Which I had once&#x2014;gloriously!&#x2014;trespassed. But that is another tale.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Here on Earth, I had only seen dogs from a distance, as Humans maintained tight control over them. Canines were kept imprisoned inside fortresses or in yards protected by high barricades known as fences. Sometimes they were even contained by force fields connected to shock collars&#x2014;a most excellent solution!<br> &nbsp;<br> Because canine discipline seemed to be the one area in which ogres behaved responsibly, I was stunned to witness what the ancient one did next.<br> &nbsp;<br> She leaned down and unclipped the rope from the canine&#x2019;s collar.

Then comes a thump on the rooftop, a scratching in the chimney, and suddenly--Santa Claus appears!<br>In her fresh imagining of Clement C. Moore's enduring poem, acclaimed master watercolorist Holly Hobbie captures the magic of this timeless tale. Her vision of the night before Christmas glows with warmth and feeling, and features the delightful addition of a child's-eye view, which magnifies the wonder of this exciting, mysterious time.</p><p>Whose tiny faces are peeking out from Santa's golden sleigh? Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, a division of Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.) (Ages 3 to 6) <i>--Marcie Bovetz</i>A classical look at old Saint Nick <br> <br>The poem "The Night Before Christmas" has become so much a part of Christmas that it&#x2019;s hard to imagine the holiday without it. Originally published as an "Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas," it appeared in 1823 in the newspaper, the Troy Sentinel. It has since been reprinted hundreds of times, acted out on stage, and read over the radio and on film and CD. The author, CLEMENT CLARKE MOORE, is said to have written the poem for his children on Christmas Eve, 1822. Our modern image of Santa Claus as a bearded, plump, jolly figure can be traced back to Moore&#x2019;s famous description of St. Nick: "He had a broad face, and a little round belly, that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly."</p><h2>That&#39;s Not Mine (You Are Not Small)</h2><p><p>Two fuzzy creatures both want to sit in the same comfy chair.

Participation in a hike through the West Virginia woods is mandatory for graduating high school seniors. Sera's misery is compounded by Lucas, the crush she's avoided. A flash flood strands the campers and their teachers Mr. Walker and Ms. Brighton on either side of a river. The next day, Sera wakes up from a drugged sleep, discovering evidence that the campers were attacked. Mr. Walker is found unconscious, and the campers are marked on their wrists: Jude, Deceptive; Emily, Damaged; Lucas, Dangerous; and Sera, Darling. Someone is targeting them for crimes, imagined or real, and they must work together to survive the hunt. Richards delivers a solid page-turner for readers who want to keep the lights on all night. With its predatory atmosphere, this book feels like The Breakfast Club folded into a Christopher Pike novel's fight for survival. The characters' ethnicities are refreshingly inclusive. However, the plot suffers from a weakness that holds it back from rising above average. The backstory behind the attack is based on a ghostly tale that readers are never sufficiently privy to, weakening the tension and at times causing actual confusion. The attacks are quite graphic and may be unsuitable for sensitive readers.

She lives in Brooklyn, New York.K-Gr 2&#x2013;Gia's mother is pregnant, and the child is not happy about it. As the story progresses, so does Gia's resentment until it all comes to a head at the Thanksgiving dinner table when she says quietly at first, and then practically yells, &#x201c;&#x2018;I'm so sick of that ding-dang baby!'&#x201d; She is sent to her room where she has time to think. Mama later shares her feelings of how she, too, is going to miss some of the things that will change when the baby comes. &#x201c;&#x2018;Those were the good old days.' says Gia. Mama says, &#x201c;&#x2018;Guess you're going to have to tell the baby all about it,' and Gia agrees, &#x2018;I guess I am.'&#x201d; From then on, the girl is reassured and her attitude changes for the better. The one thing that Gia, her mother, and the new baby already share is a love of pecan pie. This sweet universal story will have broad appeal. Blackall's full-spread illustrations done in ink and watercolor gently convey the sense of passing time, along with Gia's frustration and nostalgia regarding how things used to be and how they will change. A fine addition to the new-sibling canon.<i>Mary N. Oluonye, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i><br>� Copyright 2010. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

But first, she must tell Snail. And Snail must tell Skunk. And Skunk must tell Turtle. Each animal who tries to put off going to sleep just a little longer sees, smells, hears, or tastes the signs of the impending season. Finally, Ladybug rushes off to tell Bear--already asleep in her cave--the exciting news.</p><p>Denise Fleming presents a warm-hearted story about animals of the forest settling down for their winter nap. But, like children who must go to bed for the night, they each find a way to put it off just a little bit longer. Richly illustrated in fall colors, Denise Fleming's <i>Time to Sleep</i> world is right on target for preschoolers.</p></p><p><p><b>Denise Fleming</b> has written and illustrated many children's books, including <i>In the Tall, Tall Grass</i>, <i>Shout! Shout It Out</i>!, and <i>Sleepy, Oh So Sleepy</i>. She won a Caldecott Honor for <i>In the Small, Small Pond</i>. Denise published her first painting in the third grade, when she started taking classes at the Toledo Museum of Art and one of her paintings was chosen to be the cover of a teacher's magazine. She now works primarily with paper, by pouring colored paper pulp through hand-cut stencils. She lives in Toledo, Ohio.</p>PreS. Frost on the grass. Falling leaves. Days growing shorter. A sky full of geese. Even a skin "so tight I could not eat another bite" is a sign that winter is on its way. Clearly it's not just your everyday bedtime but the long winter's sleep we're dealing with here, as Bear smells winter in the air and gets ready to hibernate. First, though, she must tell Snail, who must tell Skunk, who must tell Turtle, and so on until Ladybug brings it full circle, waking Bear to tell her...It's Time to Sleep. Fleming uses colored cotton rag fiber to create her jewel-toned illustrations, erupting here in fiery autumn colors. Their angular composition heightens the sense of activity generated by the animals' preparations until Bear's solid, slumbering form brings it all to a cozy, comfortable close. This gem of a picture book, subtly informative and poetic in its simplicity, is certain to become a staple of seasonal storyhours and nursery-school curricula.

He's listed many ways to solve his fear of the dark, from amazing inventions to capturing the sun, but at the end of each day, "it's bedtime again." One frustrating evening his nemesis returns in a personal visit. A surprising physical hand pops out as a page extension of the immense Dark greeting young Orion with an invitation to adventure. Orion then begins a time of exploration, understanding, and even enjoyment through visits to the magical shadows of his surroundings while he makes a discovery&#x2014;"The Dark could be my friend. And nobody (not even me) is scared of their best friend." Digital cartoon illustrations with whimsical pencil doodles (including Orion in his bunny slippers) offer a wide range of fonts and humorous scribbled comments on a child's world. While the small-font doodles might not make this an easy read-aloud, a variety of text in illustrations, speech bubbles, Orion's notebook, and first-person narration create an intimate environment for an inquisitive individual reader with an interest in science and fantasy.

If you're looking for enlightenment rather than just scholarly knowledge, you'd better read this." <br>&#x2014;Robert Pirsig, author of <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i></b> <br><br> In <i>Buddhism Plain and Simple</i>, Zen priest and longtime teacher Steve Hagen presents the heart of Buddhist teachings, pared down to its essence and explained in simple, everyday language. This best-selling book is the perfect guide to Buddhism for beginners; the text has served international readers at all levels of study and practice since it was originally published over a decade ago. <br><br>More than 300,000 copies in various formats have sold to date, and now it's available in this brand new edition with a high-quality binding and paper, as well as elegant decorative illustrations scattered throughout. <br><br> Practiced by more than 1.2 million Americans and 2-3 million Europeans, Buddhism has become one of the West's largest religions. Whether you're simply interested in learning more about Buddhist philosophy, or hope to begin practicing but don't know where to start, <i>Buddhism Plain and Simple</i> will help you on your way. <br><br>"This is a book about awareness. Not awareness of something in particular, but awareness itself&#x2014;being awake, alert and in touch with what is actually happening. It's about examining and exploring the most basic questions of life. It's about relying on the immediate experience of this present moment. It's about freedom of mind. It's not about belief, doctrine, formula, or tradition." &#x2014;from the Introduction</p><p>You might want to digest this book slowly, a few pages at a time. Although Zen teacher Steve Hagen has a knack for putting the philosophy of Buddhism in a "plain and simple" package, it may take a while to sink in. There is so much there. Seeing reality, realizing the wisdom of the self, breaking free of dualistic thinking--this is pretty heady stuff. Thankfully, Hagen passes it along in the form of examples from life, psychological tidbits, and stories from Buddhist teachers past and present. And when it clicks in, it can be life-transforming. Hagen explains this shift in outlook and how the fundamental way we look at the world affects everything we do. As an outline, Hagen follows the basic teachings of the Buddha, and we see that, rather than dogmatic truths, they are reminders for us as we reconsider the life we have taken for granted for so long. As it turns out, Buddhism is life, plain and simple. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><b>Steve Hagen</b>, Roshi, has been a student and practitioner of Zen since 1967. For fifteen years he studied with Dainin Katagiri, Roshi, from whom he received Dharma Transmission (endorsement to teach) in 1980.

The result is an approach that is as effective as it is easy. For the hunter who wants a calm, steady, and obedient retriever, there's no better training method. This book provides everything needed for you to turn out a sporting dog that excels at life. Whether you want your dog to be a gundog, a water dog, a shed dog, an upland dog, a deer tracker or a fishing companion, this book charts the course Every other page exclaims, &#x201c;That makes perfect sense&#x201d;. Milner debunks a number of groundless myths and counter-productive training practices that proliferate in today&#x2019;s sporting dog culture. A big divide exists today in the gundog sector in America. The opposing views are tradition-based compulsion training versus the science-based positive training model derived from B.F. Skinner&#x2019;s operant conditioning theory. Robert Milner&#x2019;s new book bridges that gap. Milner brings to the table vast experience in both training methods. He has trained over two thousand gundogs with traditional compulsion and has trained several hundred gundogs with a positive training model. He pronounces the positive model a definitive winner. His new book covers all the bases for a beginning gundog trainer. Milner covers the dog&#x2019;s history and domestication as it relates to training. He shows you how the dog perceives the world, how the dog communicates, and how he learns. Big surprises await some readers. Milner cites many examples of recent dog research that upend traditional training theories. This book gives the reader a simple roadmap to success in producing a gundog that is extremely well-mannered, a persistent hunter and very responsive on whistle stops and hand signals. The simplicity of the training model will be a pleasant surprise to many new trainers. Most importantly, Milner&#x2019;s training model is fun for the trainer and the dog.</p><p>In 1996 Robert Milner sold Wildrose Kennels, a retriever training kennel which he had owned and operated since 1972. That same year he retired from the USAF Reserve after 26 years of service as a disaster response officer. Those two paths would cross again in 2002. Shortly after the tragedy of 9/11 Milner got a call from the Memphis Fire Department requesting his assistance with their FEMA disaster search dog program. He took the job and went to work rebuilding their disaster search dog program. Slow progress of the transformation led him to reexamine the traditional dog training model of compulsion. He adopted B.F. Skinner&#x2019;s positive training model and was able to speed up the training program by 300%. Subsequently he adapted that training model to gundog training and discovered positive training to be much faster, easier to learn and decidedly more fun for both dog and trainer. Milner has trained over 2,000 dogs with compulsion and since 2002 has trained hundreds of gundogs with a positive training protocol. He owns and operates Duckhill Kennels at Somerville, TN, breeding and training Labrador Retrievers for gundogs and also for disaster search and for explosive detection.

Told in the words of one of the most robust and memorable characters in modern fiction, Mixtli-Dark Cloud, <i>Aztec </i>reveals the very depths of Aztec civilization from the peak and feather-banner splendor of the Aztec Capital of Tenochtitlan to the arrival of Hern�n Cort�s and his conquistadores, and their destruction of the Aztec empire. The story of Mixtli is the story of the Aztecs themselves---a compelling, epic tale of heroic dignity and a colossal civilization's rise and fall.</p><p><b>Gary Jennings</b> was known for the rigorous and intensive research behind his books, which often included hazardous travel&#x2015;exploring every corner of Mexico for his Aztec novels, retracing the numerous wanderings of Marco Polo for <i>The Journeyers</i>, joining nine different circuses for <i>Spangle</i>, and roaming the Balkans for <i>Raptor</i>. Born in Buena Vista, Virginia in 1928, Jennings passed away in 1999 in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, leaving behind a rich legacy of historical fiction and outlines for new novels.<p><strong><em>DIXIT</em><strong>:<br>MY LORD<br><br>Pardon me, my lord, that I do not know your formal and fitting honorific, but I trust I do not hazard my lord&#x2019;s taking offense. You are a man, and not one man of all the men I have met in my life has ever resented being addressed as a lord. So, my lord<br>* * *<br>Your Excellency, is it?<br><em>Ayyo, even more illustrious&#x2014;what we of these lands would call an ahuaqu�huitl, a tree of great shade. Your Excellency it shall be, then. It impresses me the more that a personage of such eminent excellency should have summoned such a one as myself to speak words in Your Excellency&#x2019;s presence.</em><br>Ah, no, Your Excellency, do not demur if I appear to flatter Your Excellency. Common report throughout the city, and these your servitors here, have made plain to me how august a man you are, Your Excellency, while I am but a threadbare rag, a frayed raveling of what once was. Your Excellency is attired and arrayed and assured in your conspicuous excellency, and I am only I.<br>But Your Excellency wishes to hear of what I was. This has also been explained to me. Your Excellency desires to learn what my people, this land, our lives were like in the years, in the sheaves of years before it pleased Your Excellency&#x2019;s king and his crossbearers and crossbowmen to deliver us from our bondage of barbarism.<br>That is correct? Then Your Excellency asks no easy thing of me. How, in this little room, out of my little intellect, in the little time the gods&#x2014;the Lord God&#x2014;may have vouchsafed me to finish my roads and my days, how can I evoke the vastness of what was our world, the variety of its peoples, the events of the sheaves upon sheaves of years?<br>Think, imagine, picture yourself, Your Excellency, as that tree of great shade. See in your mind its immensity, its mighty boughs and the birds among them, the lush foliage, the sunlight upon it, the coolness it casts upon a house, a family, the girl and boy who were my sister and myself. Could Your Excellency compress that tree of great shade back into the acorn which Your Excellency&#x2019;s father once thrust between your mother&#x2019;s legs?<br><em>Yya ayya, I have displeased Your Excellency and dismayed your scribes. Forgive me, Your Excellency. I should have guessed that the white men&#x2019;s private copulation with their white women must be different&#x2014;of more delicacy&#x2014;than I have seen them perform forcibly upon our women in public. And assuredly the Christian copulation that produced Your Excellency must have been even more</em><br>* * *<br>Yes, yes, Your Excellency, I desist.<br>But Your Excellency perceives my difficulty. How to enable Your Excellency to see at a glance the difference between our inferior <em>thenand your superior </em><em>now? Perhaps one summary illustration will suffice, and you need trouble yourself with no more listening.</em><br>Look, Your Excellency, at your scribes: in our language &#x201c;the word knowers.&#x201d; I have been a scribe myself, and I well recall how hard it was to render onto fawnskin or fiber paper or bark paper so much as the unfleshed bones of historical dates and happenings, with any degree of accuracy. Sometimes it was hard even for me to read my own pictures aloud, without stumbling, after just the few moments the colors took to dry.<br>But your word knowers and I have been practicing, while awaiting Your Excellency&#x2019;s arrival, and I am amazed, I am struck with wonder, at what any one of your reverend scribes can do. He can write and read back to me not just the substance of what I speak, but every single word, and with all the intonations and pauses and stresses of my speech. I would think it a talent of memory and mimicry&#x2014;we had our word <em>rememberers, too&#x2014;but he tells me, shows me, proves to me, that it is all there on his page of paper. I congratulate myself, Your Excellency, that I have learned to speak your language with what proficiency my poor brain and tongue can attain, but your writing would be beyond me.</em><br>In our picture writing, the very colors spoke, the colors sang or wept, the colors were necessary. They were many: magentared, ocher-gold, ahu�catl-green, turquoise-blue, choc�latl, the red-yellow of the jacinth gem, clay-gray, midnight-black. And even then they were inadequate to catch every individual word, not to mention nuances and adroit turns of phrase. Yet any one of your word knowers can do just that: record every syllable forever, with a single quill instead of a handful of reeds and brushes. And, most marvelous, <em>with just one color, the rusty black decoction they tell me is ink.</em><br>Very well, Your Excellency, there you have it in an acorn&#x2014; the difference between us <em>Indiansand you white men, between our ignorance and your knowledge, between our old times and your new day. Will it satisfy Your Excellency that the mere stroke of a quill has demonstrated your people&#x2019;s right to rule and our people&#x2019;s fate to be ruled? Surely this is all that Your Excellency requires from us </em><em>Indians: a confirmation that the victor&#x2019;s conquest is ordained, not by his arms and artifice, not even by his Almighty God, but by his innate superiority of nature over lesser beings like ourselves. Your Excellency can have no further need of me or words of mine.</em><br>My wife is old and infirm and unattended. I cannot pretend that she grieves at my absence from her side, but it annoys her. Ailing and irascible as she is, her annoyance is not good for her. Nor for me. Therefore, with sincere thanks to Your Excellency for Your Excellency&#x2019;s gracious reception of this aged wretch, I bid you <br>My apologies, Your Excellency. As you remark, I have not Your Excellency&#x2019;s permission to depart at whim. I am at Your Excellency&#x2019;s service for as long as<br>* * *<br>Again my apologies. I was not aware that I had repeated &#x201c;Your Excellency&#x201d; more than thirty times in this brief colloquy, nor that I had said it in any special tone of voice. But I cannot contradict your scribes&#x2019; scrupulous account. Henceforth I will endeavor to temper my reverence and enthusiasm for your honorific, Se�or Bishop, and to keep my tone of voice irreproachable. And, as you command, I will continue.<br>* * *<br>But now, what am I to say? What should I cause your ears to hear?<br>My life has been long, as ours is measured. I did not die in infancy, as so many of our children do. I did not die in battle or in holy sacrifice, as so many have willingly done. I did not succumb to an excess of drinking, or to the attack of a wild beast, or to the creeping decay of The Being Eaten by the Gods. I did not die by contracting one of the dread diseases that came with your ships, and of which so many thousands upon thousands have perished. I have outlived even the gods, who forever had been deathless and who forever would be immortal. I have survived for more than a full sheaf of years, to see and do and learn and remember much. But no man can know everything of even his own time, and this land&#x2019;s life began immeasurably long ages before my own. It is only of my own that I can speak, only my own mat I can bring back to shadow life in your rusty black ink....<br>&#x201c;<em>There was a splendor of spears, a splendor of spears!&#x201d;</em><br>An old man of our island of Xalt�can used always to begin his battle tales that way. We listeners were captivated on the instant, and we remained engrossed, though it might have been a most minor battle he described and, once he had told the foregoing events and the outcome of it all, perhaps a very trivial tale hardly worth the telling. But he had the knack for blurting at once the most compelling highlight of a narrative, and then weaving backward and forward from it.

He has run over mountains, across Death Valley, and to the South Pole-and is probably the first person to eat an entire pizza while running. With an insight, candor, and humor rarely seen in sports memoirs (and written without the aid of a ghostwriter or cowriter), <i>Ultramarathon Man</i> has inspired tens of thousands of people-nonrunners and runners alike-to push themselves beyond their comfort zones and be reminded of "what it feels like to be truly alive," says Sam Fussell, author of <i>Muscle</i>. <br><br><i>Ultramarathon Man</i> answers the questions Karnazes is continually asked: <br><br>- Why do you do it?<br>- How do you do it?<br>- Are you insane? <br><br>And in the new paperback edition, Karnazes answers the two questions he was most asked on his book tour: <br><br>- What, exactly, do you eat?<br>- How do you train to stay in such good shape?</p></p><p>Ultra-marathoner Dean Karnazes claims "There is magic in misery." While it would be easy to write off his habit of running for 100 miles at a time&#x2014;or longer&#x2014;as mere masochism, it's impossible to not admire his tenacity in pushing his body to reach one extreme goal after another. Sure, it's gory to read about how he lost one of his big toenails from shoe friction during the Western States Endurance Run. But what registers more is that here's a guy competing in an event that includes 38,000 feet of elevation change--the equivalent of scaling the Empire State Building 30 times. <p> Despite his considerable athleticism, "Karno" argues that the first half of any race is run with one's body, and the second half with the mind. Without delving into excessively touchy-feely territory, he explores "the possibilities of self" as he completes an ultra-marathon in 120-degree heat in Death Valley, and later the first-ever marathon at the South Pole. It's an odd combination: a California surfer dude contemplating how, as Socrates said, "Suffering leads to wisdom." But Karnazes's self-motivation is utterly intriguing, and it's impossible to read this memoir without wanting to go out and run a marathon yourself.--<i>Erica Jorgensen</i></p>Dean Karnazes, who was named one of the Top 10 Ultimate Athletes by <b>Outside</b> magazine, is president of EnergyWell Natural Foods in San Francisco.</p><h2>Practicing the Presence</h2><p>Practicing the Presence is one of the four foundational books among Joel Goldsmith&#x2019;s Infinite Way writings. Goldsmith recommended that new students begin with this book, together with Living the Infinite Way. Practicing the Presence is a celebrated guide to the awareness of the divine and transcendental in our daily lives. Goldsmith writes that it was during one of his periods of contemplation that the words came to him, &#x201c;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.&#x201d; This surprised him, because at that time he was little acquainted with the Bible and only occasionally went to church. But through the study of Scripture and the practice of its teachings, Goldsmith realized that a Presence was with him, counseling, sustaining, and leading him into greater spiritual awareness. Following that realization, he traveled throughout the world, teaching others to know this Presence. Goldsmith says, &#x201c;Every person who has known dissatisfaction, incompleteness, and frustration will someday learn that there is only one missing link in this entire chain of harmonious living. That is the practice of the presence of God &#x2013; consciously, daily and hourly, abiding in some great spiritual truth of scripture, and it makes no difference which scripture: Christian, Hebrew, Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, or Moslem.&#x201d; If we begin with practicing the presence of God, it leads to an inner stillness that makes it possible to meditate. Goldsmith sets forth for the reader how to practice the presence from the moment we awaken to the moment we retire for sleep. To Goldsmith, harmonious living is all a matter of consciousness. When we have the right consciousness, we do not want things, but we express the very things which formerly we sought. So, instead of a change of circumstances, what the seeker needs is a change of consciousness. Practicing the Presence helps the seeker make that change by opening consciousness to the life by grace. In clear and direct language, Goldsmith shows that by constantly and consciously practicing the presence of God in every experience of our daily life, the struggles of existence pass and harmony is established in every department of our lives. &#x201c;Seek neither health, nor wealth, nor fame, nor fortune,&#x201d; the author writes. &#x201c;Seek first the realization of this inner kingdom and be a beholder as these outer things are added.&#x201d;</p><p><p>"A new generation of mature seekers, receptive to spiritual truth, is now discovering Joel Goldsmith's teachings, which have lost none of their relevance, aliveness and power. I foresee that those teachings will reach and impact even more people in the 21st century than during his lifetime. Joel Goldsmith's inspired and profoundly inspiring books represent a vital contribution to the spiritual awakening of humanity." </p><p>-- Eckhart Tolle</p></p><h2>Hole in My Life</h2><p><p><b>From the Newbery Award&#x2013;winning author of <i>Dead End in Norvel</i>t, this is a memoir about becoming a writer the hard way. A Printz Honor and Sibert Honor book.</b></p><p>In the summer of 1971, Jack Gantos was an aspiring writer looking for adventure, cash for college tuition, and a way out of a dead-end job. For ten thousand dollars, he recklessly agreed to help sail a sixty-foot yacht loaded with a ton of hashish from the Virgin Islands to New York City, where he and his partners sold the drug until federal agents caught up with them. For his part in the conspiracy, Gantos was sentenced to serve up to six years in prison.</p><p>In <i>Hole in My Life</i>, this prizewinning author of over thirty books for young people confronts the period of struggle and confinement that marked the end of his own youth. On the surface, the narrative tumbles from one crazed moment to the next as Gantos pieces together the story of his restless final year of high school, his short-lived career as a criminal, and his time in prison. </p><p>But running just beneath the action is the story of how Gantos&#x2015;once he was locked up in a small, yellow-walled cell&#x2015;moved from wanting to be a writer to writing, and how dedicating himself more fully to the thing he most wanted to do helped him endure and ultimately overcome the worst experience of his life. </p><p>This title has Common Core connections.</p><p>Jack Gantos is an award-winning and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of books for readers of all ages, including <i>Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key</i>, a National Book Award Finalist, and <i>Joey Pigza Loses Control</i>, a Newbery Honor book.

A gaping hole of misery is what popular young adult author Jack Gantos remembers when he thinks back to 1972, "the bleakest year of my life." Just 20 years old, Gantos was in a medium security prison for his participation in a get-rich-quick drug scam. Scared silly by the violence he saw around him daily, Gantos's only lifeline was a battered copy of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, which he painstakingly turned into an impromptu journal by scratching his own thoughts into the tiny spaces between the lines. There, he recorded both his fears and his dream of someday writing a book of his own. Before prison, Gantos had penned a scattered myriad of journals, but had never been able to pull them together into a cohesive narrative. It was during his time behind bars that he found himself growing into a focused, diligent writer who eschewed drugs for the bigger high of watching his words fill the hole once and for all. <p> Gantos, best known for his award-winning Joey Pigza titles, mines darker material here that is as deeply compelling as his lighter fare. Using short, meaty sentences, Gantos manages to write in a way that dismisses the dubious "romance" of prison, drugs, and "life on the edge" without ever sounding didactic or heavy-handed. Older teens will appreciate his candor and sheer willingness to give them the straight story. Vigorously recommended.
